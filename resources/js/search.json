When it came to making cookies, she just could not bring herself to using all the fat it called for. So she began using a little applesauce in place of some of the butter or margarine. Gradually she increased this until her finished product called for 1 cup of the sauce. This is a sweet cookie and is meant to be soft, not crunchy. I admit to being generous with the chocolate chips, nuts, and raisins. Where Mother's recipe called for a cup of each, I use at least a cup and a 1/4, or more. I also like to use whole wheat whenever I can, so I tell myself they are a healthy treat. Sometimes for a variation you could add a teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of cloves and allspice, but I don't think it really needs it. Applesauce oatmeal cookies 1/2 cup butter or margarine 1/2 cup white sugar 1/2 cup brown sugar 2 eggs 1 teaspoon vanilla 1 cup applesauce 1 cup white flour 3/4 cup whole wheat flour 1 teaspoon soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 1/2 cups old-fashioned oatmeal 1 1/4 cups chocolate chips 1 1/4 cups chopped nuts 1 1/4 cups raisins Use the mixer to beat the first six ingredients. Sift the flour, soda, and salt, and add by hand. Then combine the oatmeal, chips, nuts, and raisins. Bake on a greased cookie sheet for 11-12 minutes. This makes a little more than 5 dozen cookies."]}],[{"l":"Analaine's Home Cooking: Bread Pudding","p":["While visiting family recently in Texas, we ate at a roadside barbecue on the way to San Antonio. The barbecued ribs and chicken were excellent, but the bread pudding was out of this world! Without a doubt the best I had ever tasted.","Later, when I got back to a kitchen, I worked at re-creating this old fashioned dessert. The bottom of the pudding was thick with caramel flavor. I decided that brown sugar and butter were the secret, so I added that to the bottom of the baking dish. I also noticed that the crusts were not cut off - as you will see in most recipes. I liked the extra texture that gave to the pudding. I've tried different breads and for me, I think that day-old French bread makes the best.","There are all kinds of variations for this pudding. You can add lemon zest and juice of half a lemon, dates, raisins, nuts, crushed pineapple or orange marmalade. It can be topped with a dollop of whipped cream, or nothing at all. It is delicious served either warm or cold."]},{"l":"The Recipe","p":["4 c. diced stale bread","3 c. warm milk","3 large eggs","1/2 c. white sugar","1/4 tsp. salt","1/2 tsp. cinnamon","1 tsp. vanilla","1/4 c. butter","1/2 c. brown sugar (packed)","Soak the bread cubes in the warm milk. In another bowl, beat the eggs until light.Then add sugar, salt, cinnamon and vanilla. Combine with the bread mixture.","Put the butter and brown sugar into your baking dish. Pour pudding over that.

My friend, Marceil McKenzie, was hosting a study group in her home. After the lesson and discussion we always looked forward to dessert. This was a real hit!","I have made it many times over the years and have tried various flavors. My next favorite is pistachio pudding, so I omit the Butterfinger bars and use other nuts. Sliced almonds are a nice compliment if you can't get the pistachio nuts. I've also made this with lemon pudding, and that's delightful too. The important thing is to be sure to top it with plenty of fresh whipped cream."]},{"l":"The Recipe","p":["2 large instant vanilla pudding","4 and 2/3 c. milk","1 quart softened vanilla ice cream","1 and 1/2 c. graham cracker crumbs","1/2 c. saltine crumbs","1/3 c. melted butter","1 pint whipping cream","2 or 2 large Butterfinger candy bars","Combine crackers and melted butter.

It's a rich, moist, heavy dessert, and all it needs to go with it is a tall glass of cold milk.","Karen served it for lunch - after we had had a low-calorie salad. I, of course, asked for the recipe and was surprised at how simple it is. The first time I made it I thought I had done it wrong, because it was so hard to stir. Just dump the dry cake mix into the boiling pudding - no eggs, no oil, no milk...well, I did add an extra half cup of milk. It just seemed way too thick, but it turned out fine. Hope you like it.

I've made custards for years, but none were as good as this recipe. It does have a couple extra steps to caramelize the sugar and toast the coconut, but it is worth the time.","I've also made this without the coconut, and it's still delicious. The Italians call this \"Budino.\" In other places of the world it is known as \"Flan.\" During the cooking process the coconut rises to the top, and when inverted onto a plate, serves as a delicate crust to the creamy pudding.

My cousin, Alice, gave me this recipe over 30 years ago. She tells me that it's a hit at any party, and even goes before the brownies.","The last time I made it I thought the batter seemed a little thin, probably because I used jumbo- sized eggs, so I added a little extra flour. I shouldn't have done that. They were not as moist as usual. I should have followed the recipe precisely.

They are long gone, with grandkids of their own now. I wonder if they ever go to the bother to make this special treat. It really is incredible. Takes a bit of doing, but I think it's worth the effort to build memories."]}],[{"l":"Analaine's Home Cooking: Creamy Cherry Pie","p":["I usually make a cherry pie in February. It's tradition, I guess. My mother's birthday was in February, on Washington's birthday, in fact. We've all heard the story of him cutting down the cherry tree, though it may not be true. No birthday cake for mother. She preferred cherry pie, and we had it with homemade ice cream.","This recipe is tweaked up a bit from the basic cherry pie, but I think you will like it.

Some are starting to go soft and I need to do something with them. I've made enough applesauce, baked apples and apple pies, so I guess the next choice is apple cake.","This is a recipe I got 30 years ago from my husband's cousin, Elaine Homer, and it's a good one. It calls for four cups of apples, instead of the usual two, and that, along with the raisins, makes it extra moist.

It's a recipe I got from someone in Brigham City, Utah - which is a great peach-producing area. The lemon and orange juice along with the almond extract give it a delightful, distinct taste. It does enhance the flavor, and people will smack their lips and say, \"Oh, what is that flavoring?\" Try it. You'll be surprised at how the flavor combination complements the peaches.","My mother always used cinnamon when she cooked peaches, and that's good too.

They enhance any dry breakfast cereal. A big bowlful with sugar and cream is hard to beat, or as a topping with shortcake, even chocolate cake, and of course frozen raspberry jam. This fresh raspberry pie is a recipe I've had for years and it's so simple to make.

In fact you can make it ahead and have the dough in the freezer to pull out at a minute's notice.","The use of orange zest gives it a unique flavor.

The culls, of course, he fed to the pigs, but there would be bins of No. 2's with just a slight blemish. These he sold to friends and neighbors for just a pittance, and gave away dozens of boxes to needy families.
