# Artisan Bread - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

I was invited out to lunch recently, and the hostess served soup and homemade Artisan bread.
What a treat! Of course, I had to have her recipe, although I admit I tweaked it a bit.
After trying four different bowls and plastic containers, I decided a 5-quart ice cream bucket
was the perfect thing.

You will be surprised at how easy this is to make, and you can keep it in the fridge for a couple
of weeks if you need to.

## Artisan Bread
# 3 cups lukewarm water
# 1 1/2 tablespoons granulated yeast
# 1 tablespoon Kosher or real salt
# 7 cups all-purpose flour, unsifted

Put warm water in a 5-quart container. Sprinkle yeast on top, then add the flour and salt. Mix
with a big wooden spoon until the mixture is uniform. It is not necessary to knead it, just be
sure all the flour is mixed in. Set it on the counter and let it rise.

This could take 3 or 4 hours, depending on room temperature. When the dough fills the bucket
and begins to collapse, it is ready to use, or you can stir down and put in the fridge for use
another day. When you are ready to bake, sprinkle a little flour on the dough, pull up and cut off
a grapefruit-size piece of dough with a serrated knife.

Put some more flour on your hands and gently mold it into a smooth round ball. This should
take less than a minute. Put the dough on a piece of parchment paper and let it rise for a couple
of hours. Twenty minutes before baking, pre-heat the oven to 450°.

Put in your Cloche cooker or pizza plate to heat up first. Be sure they are well-oiled. I used my
old black cast iron frying pan. Then dip the serrated knife in hot water and make slashes across
the top of the dough about 1/4-inch deep.

Transfer the dough with the parchment paper to the hot cooking pan. Bake on middle shelf. Add
a cup or two of hot tap water to a broiler pan (to provide steam) and place on bottom rack of
oven. Bake at 450° for 30 minutes. If you have a bigger hunk of dough it could take 35 minutes.
