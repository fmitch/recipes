# Buttermilk Rolls - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

Surely, some of the world's best cooks live in Cache Valley, Utah. I've never known so many
excellent cooks as those ladies. It didn't matter if it was the Book Club, the Pioneer Women's
Meeting, the Ladies Night Out, the monthly Homemaking meeting or just a gathering in the
park. It was always a treat to see what everyone would bring.

I got this recipe for buttermilk rolls from Kathryn Smith and it has become a favorite of my
family. It's a MUST for me to make for our get-togethers. I guess you could say it has become
my "signature" dish. They are easy for me to make because I have an old Bosch mixer that I
inherited from my mother. She has been gone for 22 years now, and I know she had it for at
least 20 years before she died. It still works and I depend on it for making bread and rolls. You
can make them by hand, of course, but if you have a heavy-duty mixer with a dough hook, it is
much easier.

## Buttermilk rolls
* 2 cups buttermilk (or sour milk)
1 teaspoon soda
* 2/3 cup sugar
* 1/2 cup butter
* 2 teaspoons salt (scant)
* 3 large eggs (or 4 if smaller)
* 1 tablespoon yeast dissolved in 1/2 cup water
* 6 1/2 to 7 cups flour (or more when shaping rolls)
* 1 tablespoon oil

Put 1/2 cup lukewarm water in a small bowl. Add yeast, then sprinkle with a teaspoon of sugar
and set aside. Heat buttermilk to hot, but be careful not to let it boil. Remove from heat. Add
soda, sugar and butter. Stir until blended. Put into mixing bowl and add about half of the flour,
mixing slightly.

Beat eggs until light, add yeast mixture and then combine with the dough. Gradually add flour
and salt until it comes clean from the side of the bowl. Dough should be soft but workable. Mix
5 minutes or knead by hand. Rub 1 tablespoon oil on top.

Cover with waxed paper and let rise until double in size. Punch down and let rise again. Shape
into rolls. Cover with a clean towel and let rise again. Bake at 375Â° for 12 to minutes. Makes
dozen rolls.
