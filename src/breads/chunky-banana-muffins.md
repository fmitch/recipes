# Chunky Banana Muffins - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

I don't know why I keep buying bananas. I don't really like them, but they always look so
appetizing in the stores. I know they are good for me since they contain lots of potassium,
which I need. So I get a bunch every time I go shopping and then put them on the counter to
ripen for a day or two.
The days turn into a week or more, and then I have over-ripe bananas that are too soft and
mushy to eat. Now I'll have to turn the oven on and make banana bread, cookies or muffins.
Can't let those bananas go to waste! This muffin recipe is simple enough and I think you'll like
it.

## Chunky Banana Muffins
* 1 cube (1/2 cup) butter, softened
* 1/2 cup brown sugar, packed
* 2 large eggs
* 1 teaspoon vanilla and beat well
* 2 large bananas, mashed
* 1/3 cup milk
* 2 cups flour
* 3 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon salt

Preheat the oven to 375Â°. Lightly grease 12 muffin tins.

Cream together the butter and brown sugar. Then add the two eggs and vanilla and beat well.
Mix in the bananas and milk. The mixture will look curdled, but that's okay.

Sift together dry ingredients in a separate bowl. Add dry ingredients and stir by hand just
enough to combine. Do not over mix. Then add 3/4 cup chocolate chips and 3/4 cup chopped
walnuts.

Bake approximately 25 minutes or until muffins test done. I would check them after 20 minutes.
