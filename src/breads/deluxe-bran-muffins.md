# Deluxe Bran Muffins - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

Kellogg's All-Bran has been on my standard shopping list for years. It seemed like they always
had the recipe for All-Bran muffins on the box, but lately they've switched to specialty recipes
(and they do look very good). I failed to write down the muffin recipe when it was at my
fingertips, but my friend Judy Jensen gave me a good one years ago.

I've made some variations from time to time, and I like them either way. One method is to add
the All-Bran to the liquid and let it soak. The other way is to add it last when everything else is
mixed.

I think the flavor is the same when you do this, but the texture is a bit different. The little pieces
of bran give a delightful surprise... especially if you add the nuts.

## Recipe

* 1 cup boiling water
* 2 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
* 1/2 cup shortening
* 1 cup sugar (I use 1/2)
* 2 eggs
* 2 1/2 cups flour
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 2 cups buttermilk
* 2 cups All-Bran
* 1 cup bran flakes
* 1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

In a bowl, stir baking soda in water until dissolved. Set aside to cool while you cream sugar and
shortening in a large mixing bowl. Add eggs, beating well.

Combine flour and salt; add to the creamed mixture alternately with buttermilk. Mix in the
baking soda mixture. Fold in cereal and nuts. Fill greased muffin cups three-fourths full. Bake
at 375Â° for 20-25 minutes.
