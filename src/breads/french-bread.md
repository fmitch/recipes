# Homemade French Bread - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

I've had this recipe since the early 1970's. When we lived in Madras, Oregon, my friend Vicki
Budge would make this for the church potlucks and it was always a hit.
It's so easy to make and the perfect accompaniment for spaghetti, of course, but it's great with a
hearty bowl of homemade soup, or just about any meal.

It will really add some pizazz to dinner on a stormy fall evening. With the price of bread in the
stores nowadays, I think you will find this a considerable savings. Although Vicki made this by
hand, I find it easier to use my Bosch mixer. Here's the recipe as she wrote it out for me many
years ago.

## Homemade French Bread
Combine in a large bowl:
* 2 pkg. (2 T) dry yeast
* 3 cups flour
* 3 T sugar
* 2 tsp. salt
* Stir until well blended, then add:
* 2 1/2 cups warm water
* 1/3 cup vegetable oil
* 3 to 4 more cups of flour

Mix well with a big wooden spoon until flour is incorporated. Knead dough for 3 or 4 minutes,
then let dough rest for 10 minutes, covered with a towel. Repeat 10-minute rests for a total of 5
times. (I set my timer so I don't forget).

Divide dough in half and roll each half out into a rectangle, then roll up like a jelly-roll. Place
lengthwise on a teflon or greased cookie sheet and slash diagonally three times across loaves.
Let rise 30 – 45 minutes. Bake at 400°F. Brush loaves with egg white and sprinkle on corn meal
or sesame seeds desired. Makes 2 loaves.
