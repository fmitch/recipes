# Indian Fry Bread - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

When we lived in Central Oregon, we were close to the Warm Springs Indian Reservation. It
was a day of adventure to attend their pow-wows and root festivals.

I wasn't too fond of all the wild roots they served, but they had huge trays of Indian fry bread as
part of the menu. It was wonderful! We watched the cooks in the kitchen making huge batches
of dough in great big stainless steel bowls.

They would squeeze off a chunk about the size of a baseball and flatten it between their palms,
adding a little flour, much like you would tortillas.

I've found it easier to turn the dough out on a floured board, knead it gently, then roll it out and
cut it into strips. The leavening agent here is baking powder, rather than yeast, so it is quick and
easy to make.

My grandkids in college tell me it's a winner! Sprinkle it with cinnamon sugar, drizzle it with
honey, or top it with jam. It's a great treat with a glass of cold milk. Some even use it as a
miniature pizza or Navajo taco with refried beans and salsa. It's also the perfect complement to
a hearty bowl of soup on a cold winter night.


## Indian Fry Bread
* 2 c. flour
* 2 tsp. baking powder
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 1 1/4 c. water or milk

Sift dry ingredients together and then add the liquid. Mix gently with a fork. Dump out onto a
floured board, knead it gently and then roll out to 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick.

Cut the dough into strips and then fry them in hot oil that is at least an inch deep. Serve hot.
