# Marmalade-Nut Bread - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

One of the best things about the holidays is the baking that I do for friends and neighbors. There
used to be an ad (I think it was from Pillsbury) that said, "Nothin' says lovin' like something
from the oven," and for me, that certainly is true.
I love to bake up all kinds of goodies, from cookies, cinnamon rolls, tea cakes, to banana bread,
zucchini bread, pumpkin bread, raisin bread, etc. This marmalade-nut bread is a winner.
When I don't have marmalade on hand, I open a jar of my home-canned apricot jam, add some
shredded orange peel (cooked with a little sugar and water), and that works just fine.

The English walnuts have just been harvested here in Oregon, and I am very generous with
those. Fresh nuts just can't be beat. This recipe makes two loaves, and that's never enough, so I
usually double it. As long as the oven is on, why not?

## Marmalade-Nut Bread
* 2 3/4 cups flour
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 4 teaspoons baking powder
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 cup chopped walnuts
* 1 egg
* 1 cup orange marmalade
* 1 cup orange juice
* 1/4 cup oil

In a large mixing bowl, sift together flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Add walnuts. Toss to
coat evenly. In a medium bowl, beat the egg. Mix in the orange juice, marmalade and oil.

Then add this to the flour mixture. Stir only until the dry ingredients are mixed in. Divide batter
into two well-greased loaf pans 8 1/2" x 4 1/2".

Bake at 350Â° for 1 hour, or until toothpick in center comes out clean. Cool in pans on rack for at
least 10 minutes before removing from pans. Cool thoroughly. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap or
foil. Allow flavors to mellow overnight before serving.
