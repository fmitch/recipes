# Flora's Onion-Dill Bread - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

This is a recipe I've had for nearly 40 years. It came from my friend, Flora Moschetti, who lives
in Madras, Oregon.
It's not a recipe I make very often, but it is a welcome addition to a hot bowl of soup, a nice
spring salad, or in a sandwich.

It's really quite simple to make, although if you don't have a bread mixer, I would suggest
blending the cottage cheese in a blender with the sour cream, egg, and yeast mixture. Otherwise
you will have these little specks of curd in the bread.

Her original recipe called for all white flour, but I like to use at least half whole wheat. Today
we had it in a tuna fish sandwich with cream cheese and it was delicious!

## Flora's Onion-Dill Bread
* 1 TB yeast in 1/2 cup lukewarm water, sprinkle 1 TB sugar on the top

Warm and mix together:
* 3/4 cup cottage cheese
* 3/4 cup sour cream (sometimes I use yogurt)
* 2 TB sugar
* 1 1/2 TB butter
* 1 1/2 tsp. salt
* 1 egg
* 3 TB minced dry onion
* 2 TB whole dill seed
* 4 cups flour, plus a little more

Soften yeast in warm water. Blend cottage cheese with sour cream, egg, butter, sugar and salt.
Put into bread mixer with yeast and 3 cups flour.

Add more flour. It may take as much as 5 cups total. Mix 8-10 minutes. Let rise until double in
size. Put into greased bread pans and let rise again. Bake @ 350Â° for 30 to 35 minutes. Makes 2
loaves.
