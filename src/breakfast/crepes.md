# Crepes
Optional subheader for description

## info  
* Source: Food Network (courtesy of Alton Brown)
* Makes: enough for 2 adults

## ingredients
* 2 large eggs
* 3/4 cup milk
* 1/2 cup water
* 1 cup flour
* 3 tablespoons melted butter
  
## method  
1. Whisk all ingredients until well combined (or pulse in a blender). Place crepe batter in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
2. Heat a small non-stick pan. Add butter to coat. Pour 1/4-1/3 cup of batter into the center of the pan and swirl to spread evenly. Cook for 30 seconds and flip. Cook for another 10 seconds and remove to a flat surface (plate or cutting board) to cool. 
3. Repeat until batter is gone.


## notes  
* Refrigerating the batter allows the bubbles to subside so the crepes will be less likely to tear during cooking. The batter will keep for up to 48 hours.
* After crepes have cooled, they can be stacked and stored in sealed plastic bags in the refrigerator for several days or in the freezer for up to two months. If frozen, thaw crepes on a rack before gently peeling apart and reheating.
