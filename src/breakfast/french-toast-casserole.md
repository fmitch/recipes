# French Toast Casserole - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

It was Christmas morning with my daughter Sharon. I had gone over early to enjoy the
morning's festivities. Grandparents everywhere delight in watching their grandkids on
Christmas morning - with camera in hand, of course.
Christmas carols played in the background as the unwrapping of gifts wound down. A time of
blissful content - being with your loved ones on Christmas Day. I sat in the big easy chair,
reveling in the moment, when Sharon came from the kitchen with plates of a steaming hot
breakfast. What a nice surprise!
"When did you have time to make this?" I asked her.
"It was easy," she said. "I did it last night, and all I had to do was pop it in the oven a few
minutes ago."
Since then it has become a tradition with her family and mine. I think you'll like it. It really does
add a nice touch to any festive occasion.

## Christmas Morning Breakfast
* 1 loaf of French bread cut into 1-inch cubes
* 1 8-ounce package of cream cheese, cut into tiny cubes (tip: dip your knife in ice water)
* 8 eggs beaten
* 2 1/2 cups milk
* 1/2 cup butter, melted
* 1/4 cup maple syrup

Grease a 9x13 pan. Spread half of the bread cubes over the bottom, then layer the cream cheese
cubes on the bread. Top with remaining bread cubes. In a separate bowl, beat eggs, milk, melted
butter and syrup until well mixed. Pour over bread. Using a firm hand press the contents of pan
thoroughly to moisten. Cover with plastic wrap and put in refrigerator for at least 2 hours
(overnight works great, but don't push it past 24 hours.)

Preheat oven to 325Â°. Bake 35-40 minutes until the center is set and the edges are slightly
golden. Makes enough for 8-10. Serve hot with [apple cider syrup](../sauces/apple-cider-syrup.md).
