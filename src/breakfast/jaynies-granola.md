# Jaynie's Granola - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

My daughter-in-law Jaynie is a great fan of snacks and "munchies", especially if they are
healthy. This is a recipe she gave me years ago. It's pretty basic, but quite tasty and easy to
make. You can add all sorts of extra things to it, like raisins, currants, dried cranberries and
various nuts. She lives in Texas where pecans are plentiful. I use walnuts since I live in Oregon
and can get them from local farmers. Slivered almonds are especially good.

A couple cups of crispy rice cereal gives it a nice crunch. You might even try adding a little
molasses if you like that flavor. If you do that, just a touch of ginger will enhance the flavor.
This is a great treat for family night playing games around the table.

## Jaynie's Granola
* 7 cups old-fashioned oats
* 2 cups coconut
* 1/2 cup wheat germ
* 1 cup brown sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 tablespoon cinnamon (more if you like)
* 1 or 2 cups chopped nuts

Put these dry ingredients in a large bowl (I use a big plastic Tupperware).

Mix together in a small bowl: 1/2 cup water, 1/2 cup oil, 1 tablespoon vanilla and 1 cup peanut
butter.

Put this in microwave for 20 seconds or so to soften. Blend well, then pour over the dry
ingredients. Mix together with large spoon or spatula. Spread out on cookie sheet (13x17).

Bake at 200Â° for 2 hours. When cool put in plastic container. Will keep for weeks (unless you
have hungry kids around).
