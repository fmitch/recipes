# Potato Pancakes - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

This is an old recipe of my mother's. I had not made it for ages, but I came across it recently.
Since we lived in potato country and potatoes were plentiful, you can guess we had them about
every meal.
They were good for filling up my 4 younger brothers.
You may be surprised at the combination of orange peel and parsley, but it works!

Sometimes I add green or red bell pepper. I've made these as a side dish for lunch and even
dinner. They are a little similar to a zucchini fritter. I think you'll like them.

## Potato Pancakes
* 4 medium potatoes
* 2 eggs, beaten
* 1/4 cup milk
* 1/4 cup flour
* 1/4 tea spoon baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon pepper
* 1/2 medium onion, grated
* 1 TB grated orange peel
* 2 TB chopped parsley
* 1/4 c. vegetable oil

Finely grate potatoes. In another bowl beat the eggs, add the milk, potatoes, and the rest of the
ingredients (except oil). Put oil on a large frying pan or griddle. Place large spoonfuls of potato
mixture a few inches apart.

Fry at medium-hot until brown and crispy. Turn and cook other side. Keep warm while frying
remaining pancakes. Serve with grilled or broiled meats, or even a baked apple.
