# Apple Strudel - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

My son Alan spent 2 years in Austria, and came home with this recipe. He managed to coax it
out of a quaint little grandmother there.
It's not as good as the standard American apple pie, but it's a popular dessert there, and is quick
and easy to make. The dough is made with flour, oil, egg and water, and goes together fast.

The use of bread crumbs is interesting, because you don't really taste them. They act as a
binding agent for the apples.
This is best made with Granny Smiths or tart winter apples that don't go mushy, although I have
made it with other varieties and added a little lemon juice. If you use a summer apple you won't
want to cook it quite as long, maybe only 15 to 20 minutes.

## Apple strudel

### Pastry
* 3/4 cup flour
* 1 egg
* 1 tablespoon oil
* 1 tablespoon water
* pinch of salt
### Filling
* 3 cups apples
* 3/4 cup sugar
* 1/4 cup raisins
* 3/4 cup bread crumbs
* 3/4 cup butter — divided
* cinnamon

Mix pastry ingredients together, and work into a smooth dough. Cover and let stand for 20-30
minutes. Roll out paper-thin on cloth dusted with flour. You may need to add a little extra flour
here. Brush with melted butter.

For the filling melt half of the butter in a small pan. Add bread crumbs and stir together. Slice
apples very thin. Layer bread crumbs, then a thick layer of apples, then raisins, sugar, and
cinnamon.

Roll together like cinnamon rolls, but don't cut. Place with joint down on a greased baking dish.
Brush with melted butter.

Bake at 350° for 30 minutes, until golden brown. Brush again with butter. Dust with powdered
sugar. It's best served warm.
