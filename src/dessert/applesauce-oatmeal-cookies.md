# Analaine's Home Cooking: Applesauce oatmeal cookies
This recipe is one of my mother's. When it came to making cookies, she just could not bring
herself to using all the fat it called for. So she began using a little applesauce in place of some
of the butter or margarine. Gradually she increased this until her finished product called for 1
cup of the sauce.
This is a sweet cookie and is meant to be soft, not crunchy. I admit to being generous with the
chocolate chips, nuts, and raisins. Where Mother's recipe called for a cup of each, I use at least a
cup and a 1/4, or more.
I also like to use whole wheat whenever I can, so I tell myself they are a healthy treat.
Sometimes for a variation you could add a teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of cloves and
allspice, but I don't think it really needs it.
Applesauce oatmeal cookies
1/2 cup butter or margarine
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 cup applesauce
1 cup white flour
3/4 cup whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 1/2 cups old-fashioned oatmeal
1 1/4 cups chocolate chips
1 1/4 cups chopped nuts
1 1/4 cups raisins
Use the mixer to beat the first six ingredients. Sift the flour, soda, and salt, and add by hand.
Then combine the oatmeal, chips, nuts, and raisins. Bake on a greased cookie sheet for 11-12
minutes. This makes a little more than 5 dozen cookies.
