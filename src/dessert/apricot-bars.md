# Apricot Bars - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

This recipe came from a friend of my daughter. Helen was the mother of 7 children. She
claimed it was a delicious, nutritious snack, and I agree. It seemed a little sweet to me, so I've
cut back a bit on the sugar.
This is a good way to use up old jam. I've made it with peach jam and it's equally good. I've also
used raisins. Soften a cup of them in the microwave with just 2 TB water for a minute or so.

I suppose you could call these "Fruit Bars," depending on the variation you make. Be sure to let
them cool completely before cutting.

## Apricot Bars
* 1 cup whole wheat flour
* 1 cup white flour
* 1 cup margarine (or 3/4 cup butter)
* 1 1/2 cup oats
* 3/4 cup brown sugar
* 1 tsp. baking powder
* 1 cup apricot jam
* 1/2 cup nuts

Mix together flour and baking powder. Cut butter into the mixture with a pastry blender until
crumbly. Then add brown sugar and oats. Mix well.

Spray a 9"x13" pan with cooking spray. Pat 2/3 of the mixture into pan — use the palm of your
hand to flatten. Spread jam over the top. Sprinkle with remaining mixture. Pat down again.

Bake at 350° for 30-35 minutes. Cool and cut into bars.
