# Analaine's Home Cooking: Bread Pudding
While visiting family recently in Texas, we ate at a roadside barbecue on the way to San
Antonio. The barbecued ribs and chicken were excellent, but the bread pudding was out of this
world! Without a doubt the best I had ever tasted.

Later, when I got back to a kitchen, I worked at re-creating this old fashioned dessert. The
bottom of the pudding was thick with caramel flavor. I decided that brown sugar and butter
were the secret, so I added that to the bottom of the baking dish. I also noticed that the crusts
were not cut off - as you will see in most recipes. I liked the extra texture that gave to the
pudding. I've tried different breads and for me, I think that day-old French bread makes the best.

There are all kinds of variations for this pudding. You can add lemon zest and juice of half a
lemon, dates, raisins, nuts, crushed pineapple or orange marmalade. It can be topped with a
dollop of whipped cream, or nothing at all. It is delicious served either warm or cold.

## The Recipe
* 4 c. diced stale bread
* 3 c. warm milk
* 3 large eggs
* 1/2 c. white sugar
* 1/4 tsp. salt
* 1/2 tsp. cinnamon
* 1 tsp. vanilla
* 1/4 c. butter
* 1/2 c. brown sugar (packed)

Soak the bread cubes in the warm milk. In another bowl, beat the eggs until light.Then add
sugar, salt, cinnamon and vanilla. Combine with the bread mixture.

Put the butter and brown sugar into your baking dish. Pour pudding over that. Set in a pan of
hot water. Bake the pudding at 350° for approximately 45 minutes (an 8x8 Pyrex pan cooks in
45 min – a deeper dish takes longer).
