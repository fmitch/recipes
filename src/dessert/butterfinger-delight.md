# Analaine's Home Cooking: Butterfinger Delight
It was over 30 years ago when I first tasted this delicious treat. My friend, Marceil McKenzie,
was hosting a study group in her home. After the lesson and discussion we always looked
forward to dessert. This was a real hit!

I have made it many times over the years and have tried various flavors. My next favorite is
pistachio pudding, so I omit the Butterfinger bars and use other nuts. Sliced almonds are a nice
compliment if you can't get the pistachio nuts. I've also made this with lemon pudding, and
that's delightful too. The important thing is to be sure to top it with plenty of fresh whipped
cream.

## The Recipe
* 2 large instant vanilla pudding
* 4 and 2/3 c. milk
* 1 quart softened vanilla ice cream
* 1 and 1/2 c. graham cracker crumbs
* 1/2 c. saltine crumbs
* 1/3 c. melted butter
* 1 pint whipping cream
* 2 or 2 large Butterfinger candy bars

Combine crackers and melted butter. Mash 3/4 of this mixture into a 9x13 pyrex dish. Put in
refrigerator for a few minutes. Mix pudding and milk and stir in the soft ice cream. Pour onto
crumb mixture. Let set, then top with whipped cream. Crush butterfingers, add to remaining
crumbs and sprinkle on top. Keep refrigerated until ready to serve. Makes 12-15 servings.
