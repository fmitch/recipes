# Analaine's Home Cooking: Melba's Caramel Corn
I must have more than a dozen recipes for caramel corn that I've gathered over the years. Each
one is supposed to be the very best. One is made with vinegar, another with cream of tartar. One
says to use only white sugar, another has a combination of white and brown.

One calls for white corn syrup, another specifies dark. Some recipes have no butter at all. Some
use as much as a cup. One says to add a little butter at the end when you put in the soda. So I
guess do whatever works for you.

The secret is in baking it in a slow oven for an hour. My daughter and I have tried them all, and
declare Melba Penrod, from Logan, Utah as the winner. Melba was older than 80 when I knew
her 30 years ago, so I would guess she's made a few batches in her lifetime.

## Melba's Caramel Corn
* 2 cups brown sugar
* 1 cup butter
* 1/2 cup corn syrup dark or light
* 1 teaspoon vanilla
* 1/2 teaspoon soda

Boil butter, syrup, and brown sugar for 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Add vanilla,
then soda. Stir with a big wooden spoon as it will fizz up. Pour over 6 quarts popped corn. Mix
well. I use roasting pan. Bake at 250Â° for an hour. Stir every 15 minutes. Peanuts can be added
if you like.
