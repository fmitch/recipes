# Caramel Pudding Cake
From Analaine's Home Cooking

I got this recipe many years ago while visiting my friend Karen Radich, who lives on the
Oregon coast. It's a rich, moist, heavy dessert, and all it needs to go with it is a tall glass of cold
milk.

Karen served it for lunch - after we had had a low-calorie salad. I, of course, asked for the
recipe and was surprised at how simple it is. The first time I made it I thought I had done it
wrong, because it was so hard to stir. Just dump the dry cake mix into the boiling pudding - no
eggs, no oil, no milk...well, I did add an extra half cup of milk. It just seemed way too thick, but
it turned out fine. Hope you like it. Admittedly, the calorie content is way high.

## The Recipe
* 1 pkg. butterscotch pudding (NOT instant)
* 2 c. milk
* 1 box yellow cake mix
* 1/2 c. milk
* 1 pkg. butterscotch chips
* chopped walnuts - 1/2 cup or more

Make pudding as directed on box. When it gets to the boiling point, remove from stove and stir
in the dry cake mix, along with 1‚ÅÑ2-cup milk. Put into a greased, 9x13 pan. Sprinkle a package of
butterscotch chips and the nuts on top. Bake at 350 for approximately 30 minutes, until a
toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Can be served either warm or cold.
