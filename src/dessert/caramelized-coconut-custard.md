# Analaine's Home Cooking: Caramelized Coconut Custard
If you are looking for a dessert that is smooth, creamy, and full of flavor, then here is one for
you. I've made custards for years, but none were as good as this recipe.
It does have a couple extra steps to caramelize the sugar and toast the coconut, but it is worth
the time.

I've also made this without the coconut, and it's still delicious. The Italians call this "Budino." In
other places of the world it is known as "Flan."
During the cooking process the coconut rises to the top, and when inverted onto a plate, serves
as a delicate crust to the creamy pudding. With the caramel on top, this coconut custard
certainly delivers. This recipe serves 8.

## The Receipe
* 1 1/2 cup sweet shredded coconut
* 1 cup sugar (to caramelize)
* 8 large eggs
* 3 cups whole milk
* 1 more cup sugar
* 3 tablespoons flour
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
* cooking spray

Directions: Spread coconut out on a baking sheet and place in pre-heated oven at 325°. Toast,
stirring occasionally until golden brown, about 7-8 minutes. Remove. Let cool.

Put in food processor or blender and pulse until coconut is finely ground. Set aside. In a small
pan, spread out sugar and melt over medium heat. Watch carefully.

Stir and cook until sugar turns a light brown caramel color. Remove from heat and pour into 8
small pyrex custard dishes which have been sprayed with cooking spray. Set aside.

In a large mixing bowl beat eggs until foamy. Add sugar, then milk, flour, vanilla and coconut.
Mix well. Fill custard dishes and put them in a large baking pan and pour hot water around the
dishes to a depth of 1 inch.

Place in pre-heated oven (325°) for 45 to 50 minutes, until pudding tests done in the center.
Remove from oven. Cool 10 minutes. Invert onto a serving plate. Can be served either hot or
cold.
