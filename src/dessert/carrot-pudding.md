# Carrot Pudding - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

My mother was an excellent cook, but she did not do pie. Cobblers and cakes, yes, but not pies.
I think it was because she just couldn't bring herself to put in all the fat it takes to make a fine
pie crust. So for holiday dinners we usually had this steamed carrot pudding, although she
called it carrot suet pudding, as that's what we used back then.

When my dad would butcher a cow or pig in the fall, he would save the fat. Mother would
render it out for homemade soap, or grind some up for kitchen use. Her recipe called for 1 cup
suet, but I substitute 1/2 cup butter. This was a favorite of my Grandma Durrant, who was
English. It was a tradition in her family. Grandma always added currants, but I don't care for
them, so I use 1 cup chopped, cooked prunes instead.

Sometimes Mother added candied lemon, orange peel, or cut-up gumdrops. She would make a
caramel, lemon or orange sauce to go on top. Many years ago she would steam it in a shortening
can, but they are plastic now, so I find that four wide-mouth pint jars are just right for a batch.
They are easy to serve out of and it doesn't cut the cooking time. It's quite rich, so the servings can be small.

## Carrot Pudding
* 1 cup sugar
* 1 cup flour
* 1/2 cup butter
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 2 eggs, beaten
* 1 teaspoon cinnamon
* 1 cup chopped nuts
* 1/2 teaspoon cloves
* 1 teaspoon nutmeg
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 cup chopped dates
* 1 cup cooked prunes
* 1 1/2 cups fine breadcrumbs
* 3/4 cup raisins
* 1 cup grated raw carrot

Cream together butter and sugar. Add eggs and beat until light and fluffy. Stir in carrots, nuts
and fruits, followed by the dry ingredients. Put into 1 1/2 quart mold (or 4 pint jars). Spray
inside of jar with Pam. Fill only 2/3 full. Place in large kettle with a rack on the bottom. Cover
with lid. Steam for 1 1/2 hours. Serves 10-12.

## Sauce
Carmelize 1/2 cup sugar in small saucepan. Stir constantly when it starts to brown. If it scorches
it will be bitter.

When dark golden brown, add 1 cup water and bring to boil. Then add another 1/2 cup sugar, 1
tablespoon butter, 1/2 cup evaporated milk, and just a pinch of salt. Mix 2 tablespoons
cornstarch in 1/4 cup water and stir into the boiling sauce. When thick add 1/4 teaspoon vanilla.
Best served hot.
