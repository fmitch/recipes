# Cherry Chews - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

This is a little late for Christmas, but maybe it's perfect timing for your Valentine Day party.
My cousin, Alice, gave me this recipe over 30 years ago. She tells me that it's a hit at any party,
and even goes before the brownies.

The last time I made it I thought the batter seemed a little thin, probably because I used jumbo-
sized eggs, so I added a little extra flour. I shouldn't have done that. They were not as moist as
usual. I should have followed the recipe precisely. These bars are rich enough without icing – a
dusting of powdered sugar is enough.

Cherry Chews
* 3 cubes of butter
* 3 cups sugar
* 2 tsp. vanilla
* 1 tsp. almond flavoring
* 6 eggs
* 1 8-oz bottle maraschino cherries
* 2 3/4 cups flour
* 1 cup coconut
* 1 cup nuts

Have butter at room temperature and cream together with the sugar. Add eggs one at a time,
beating well after each addition. Add extracts. Drain and slice the maraschino cherries. Add to
the egg mixture, then the flour, coconut and nuts. (I usually remove the bowl from the mixer,
and stir these in by hand).

Spread on a greased cookie sheet (12"x16"). Bake at 350°F for about 25 minutes. Test for
doneness with a toothpick. When cool, dust with powdered sugar. Cut into bars.
