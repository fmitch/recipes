# Chocolate Snow Crackles - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

I have 8 granddaughters, ranging in age from 16 to 26, and they all like to cook, some more
than others. Time spent with them in the kitchen is the source of many sweet memories for me.

One year, when Rebecca was home on a break from college, she and I were making cookies for
a family get-together. We had done the usual chocolate chip, peanut butter, and oatmeal
cookies.

"Oh, Grandma," she said, "I have found a new recipe for Chocolate Snow Crackles. We should
make some. They look pretty, they're good, and they are easy to do."

She was right, and while the recipe didn't call for chocolate chips or nuts, they certainly could
be added. The recipe uses oil instead of butter or shortening. I suppose that's why they have the
cracks on top. They are a little sticky to work with, so it's a good idea to chill the dough for at
least 20 minutes or so before you roll them into balls.

Also don't over-bake them, 8 minutes is really enough time. Be sure NOT to grease the baking
sheet. This makes about 4-dozen soft, yummy cookies.

## Chocolate Snow Crackles
Beat in a mixer:
* 3 eggs
* 2 cups sugar
* 1/2 cup salad oil
* 1 teaspoon vanilla

Sift together dry ingredients and add by hand to egg mixture:
* 2 1/2 to 3 cups flour ( if eggs are extra large, you will need the extra flour)
* 6 tablespoons dry cocoa
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon salt

Chill in refrigerator for 20-30 minutes. Form into balls and roll in 1 cup of powdered sugar.
Place on ungreased pan. Bake @ 350Â° for 8 minutes.
