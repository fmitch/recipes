# Chocolate Zucchini Zappers - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

How many more ways can you use zucchini? Here's one I think you'll like. You can't even tell
there is zucchini in it, but it does make for a moist, yummy treat.

My grandson had eaten two or three before I mentioned the word zucchini, and he wrinkled up
his nose at that, but then reached for more. The recipe came from a cookbook some friends put
together in 1973. Hope you enjoy it.

## Recipe

* 1 1/4 cups sugar
* 1/2 cup oil
* 1 egg
* 2 teaspoons vanilla
* 2 cups zucchini, peeled and shredded
* 2 cups flour
* 1/3 cup cocoa
* 1 1/2 teaspoons soda
* 1/2 teaspoon salt

Cream together oil, egg, sugar and vanilla. Add zucchini by hand, then the dry ingredients. Pour
into a greased and floured 9x13 pan. Bake at 350Â° for 25 to 30 minutes until it tests done. Top
with chocolate frosting and cut into bars when cool.
