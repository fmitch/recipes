# Analaine's Home Cooking: Coconut Cake
When my kids were little they thought it was great fun to have an Easter cake that was covered
with green "coconut grass" and topped with small Easter eggs.
They are long gone, with grandkids of their own now. I wonder if they ever go to the bother to
make this special treat.
It really is incredible. Takes a bit of doing, but I think it's worth the effort to build memories.

Coconut Cake
* 5 eggs, separated
* 2 cups sugar
* 1/2 cup soft butter
* 1/2 cup canola oil
* 1/2 tsp. vanilla
* 1 tsp. coconut extract
* 2 1/4 cup cake flour
* 1 tsp. baking powder
* 1/2 tsp. baking soda
* 1/4 tsp. salt
* 1 cup buttermilk
* 1/4 tsp. cream of tartar

Frosting:
* 1 pkg. (8 oz) softened cream cheese
* 1/2 cup soft butter
* 4 cup confectioners' sugar
* 1 tsp. coconut extract
* 2 cup flaked coconut
* few drops of green food coloring
* candy Easter eggs

Directions: Place the egg whites in a large bowl, and let stand at room temp for 30 minutes. In
another bowl, beat the sugar, butter, oil until light and fluffy. Add egg yolks one at a time,
beating well. Mix in the extracts.

Sift dry ingredients together & add to creamed mixture alternately with buttermilk. Add cream
of tartar to egg whites. Beat with a clean beater until stiff peaks form. Gently fold into batter.
(Batter will be quite stiff).

Put batter into 3 greased and floured 9-inch baking pans. Bake at 325Â° for 25-30 min. until it
tests done. Cool for at least 10 minutes before moving to wire racks to cool completely.

*For frosting*: Beat the cream cheese and butter until fluffy. Add powdered sugar and extract
and beat until smooth. Frost cake. Color the coconut by putting 3 or 4 drops of food coloring in
a quart jar that has been rinsed with cold water.

Add half of the coconut and shake well. Dump out in a bowl and repeat with the other half.
Sprinkle coconut all over the top and sides. Top with candy Easter eggs. Refrigerate for 2 hours
before cutting. Serves 12 to 16.
