# Coconut Chews - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

If you're a coconut lover, you've got to try these Coconut Chews.

Many years ago when I was teaching 2nd grade, I had a room mother, Mrs. Titus, who loved to
bring treats to school. It didn't matter if it was Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Valentine's
Day, or just somebody's birthday, she would send some goodies with her son Mark. This doesn't
happen in today's world, but in the 1970s there were no restrictions on homemade goodies.
Mark was a struggling student having great difficulty learning to read. This simple gesture by
his mother made him a favorite among his classmates. He became a leader on the playground
and I watched his self esteem improve in the classroom. I've often reflected on Mark's situation.
How could a plate full of sweets help a kid to read? I've determined that it showed caring,
concern, and devotion to a struggling son. It brought acceptance from his peers, and with that an
enhanced desire to learn. What do you think?

## Coconut Chews
Mix together and press in the bottom of a 9x13 pan (I use Pyrex): 3/4 cup soft butter, 3/4 cup
powdered sugar, 1 1/2 cups flour and bake at 325° for 12-15 minutes.

While that's baking, beat together: 3 eggs, 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 tsp. vanilla.

Sift together: 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 tsp. baking powder and 1/4 tsp. salt.

Mix this with the egg and sugar mixture and then add: 1 cup coconut and 1/2 cup chopped
walnuts.

Spread this mixture over the hot baked layer and bake an additional 20 minutes at 325°.

While warm, top with orange frosting made from 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, 1 Tbsp. soft butter
and 2 Tbsp. orange juice concentrate.


Beware: these are loaded with calories.
