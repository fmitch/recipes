# Creamy Cherry Pie - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

I usually make a cherry pie in February. It's tradition, I guess.
My mother's birthday was in February, on Washington's birthday, in fact.
We've all heard the story of him cutting down the cherry tree, though it may not be true.
No birthday cake for mother. She preferred cherry pie, and we had it with homemade ice cream.

This recipe is tweaked up a bit from the basic cherry pie, but I think you will like it. The nuts in
the crust make it very tasty. Sometimes I add all of the whipped cream to the cherries. Other
times just half and save the rest for topping.

## Creamy Cherry Pie
### Crust
* 1 cup flour
* 1 cup finely chopped walnuts
* 1/2 cup butter, softened
* 1/4 cup packed brown sugar
### Filling
* 1 (8 oz) pkg. cream cheese, softened
* 1 cup confectioners' sugar (divided)
* 1/4 tsp. almond extract
* 1 pint heavy whipping cream
* 1 can cherry pie filling

### Directions
 In a small bowl combine the flour, butter, walnuts and brown sugar. Press into a
greased 9" pie plate, pressing firmly on the bottom and up the sides. Bake at 375Â° for 15
minutes. Remove and chill for 30-40 minutes. After 10 minutes or so I usually put this in the
fridge for a while.

Beat the whipping cream, adding 1/3 cup of powdered sugar. Set aside in fridge. Then beat the
cream cheese, almond extract and 2/3 cup powdered sugar. Spread this over the bottom of the
crust. Gently fold the whipped cream into the pie filling, and spread this over the cream cheese
layer. Chill at least 3 or 4 hours before serving.
