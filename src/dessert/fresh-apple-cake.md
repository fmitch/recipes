# Analaine's Home Cooking: Fresh Apple Cacke
The box of apples in the garage won't keep forever. Some are starting to go soft and I need to do
something with them. I've made enough applesauce, baked apples and apple pies, so I guess the
next choice is apple cake.

This is a recipe I got 30 years ago from my husband's cousin, Elaine Homer, and it's a good one.
It calls for four cups of apples, instead of the usual two, and that, along with the raisins, makes
it extra moist. If I'm serving it warm I just dust the top with a generous amount of powdered
sugar. Otherwise, use your favorite frosting. My son-in-law likes a big scoop of whipped cream
and a drizzle of caramel topping which makes a delicious dessert!

## Ingredients
* 2 c. sugar
* 2 1/2 c. flour
* 2 eggs
* 2 tsp. soda
* 4 c. grated apples
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 3/4 c. oil
* 1/2 tsp. nutmeg
* 2 tsp. vanilla
* 1 tsp. cinnamon
* 3/4 c. raisins
* 3/4 c. chopped nuts

# Method
Beat eggs and sugar together until light. Add oil, beating in with vanilla. Then add apples. Sift
together flour, salt, soda and spices. Fold in gently by hand, adding the nuts and raisins. Do not
over-mix. Put into 9x13 greased pan. Bake at 325° (if Pyrex) for 25 min, then reduce heat to
300° for another 20 minutes or so. Test for doneness with a toothpick. Sprinkle with powdered
sugar and enjoy!
