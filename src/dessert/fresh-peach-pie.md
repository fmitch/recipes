# Fresh Peach Pie - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

The next best thing to a fresh peach picked right off the tree is this Fresh Peach Pie.
It's a recipe I got from someone in Brigham City, Utah - which is a great peach-producing area.
The lemon and orange juice along with the almond extract give it a delightful, distinct taste. It
does enhance the flavor, and people will smack their lips and say, "Oh, what is that flavoring?"
Try it. You'll be surprised at how the flavor combination complements the peaches.

My mother always used cinnamon when she cooked peaches, and that's good too. It's best
served cold and topped with plenty of real whipped cream. Vanilla ice cream will also do. After
all, summer is a time for peaches and ice cream, isn't it?


## ingredients
* 3 to 4 cups of sliced fresh peaches
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice
* 1/2 cup sugar (or more, depending on the peach)
* Orange juice (3 or 4 tablespoons)
* Lemon juice (another teaspoon)
* 3 tablespoons cornstarch
* 2 tablespoons butter
* Dash of salt
* 1/4 teaspoon almond extract
* 1 baked 9" pastry shell
* Whipped cream
* Toasted coconut (optional)

## method
Slice peaches, sprinkle with sugar and lemon juice. Allow peaches to stand for one hour. Drain,
reserving juice. To the peach juice, add enough orange juice (and a teaspoon more lemon juice)
to make 1 1/4 cups of liquid. Taste.
Add a bit more sugar if desired. Put juice in saucepan with cornstarch. Mix well. Cook over low
to medium heat, stirring constantly until thick. Remove from heat. Add butter, salt and almond
extract. Let it cool somewhat, then carefully fold sliced peaches into the sauce.
Allow filling to cool completely before pouring into the baked pastry shell. Chill. Top with
whipped cream. Adding toasted coconut to the top gives it little extra flair.
