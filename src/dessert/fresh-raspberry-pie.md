# Fresh Raspberry Pie - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

The raspberries are on, and we have thoroughly enjoyed them. They enhance any dry breakfast
cereal.
A big bowlful with sugar and cream is hard to beat, or as a topping with shortcake, even
chocolate cake, and of course frozen raspberry jam.
This fresh raspberry pie is a recipe I've had for years and it's so simple to make.
It requires a baked pie shell, so use your favorite recipe for that, and be sure it is cooled
completely before putting the berries into it.
This can be topped with whipped cream, or a generous helping of vanilla ice cream on the side.

## Fresh raspberry pie
* 4 cups fresh raspberries
* 1 1/2 cups sugar
* 1 1/2 cups water
* 4 tablespoons cornstarch
* 1 package (3 ounces) raspberry jello

### Directions
Wash and drain raspberries well before putting them into a baked pie shell. In a saucepan over
medium heat make a sauce with the sugar, water, and cornstarch. Boil this until it thickens.

Sometimes I add just a pinch of salt. Then add the dry jello. Mix well, and let it cool slightly for
a few minutes. Pour over the raspberries and let set. Serve cold with whipped cream or ice
cream.
