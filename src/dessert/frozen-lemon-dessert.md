# Frozen Lemon Dessert - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

I am fortunate to have friends who love to cook, and are happy to share their recipes. This one
came from Pat O'Brien who lives in Milwaukie, Oregon. She spear-headed the publishing of a
cookbook to help raise money for a new organ for their church.

This was back in 1979, and I've used dozens of those recipes over the years. Not one of them
has been a failure, although sometimes I change them a little. This is the case here.
The first time I made it, I thought it was a little too runny, so next time I made it I added some
cornstarch to thicken it up a bit. This treat beats any dessert made with lemon jello. I think
you'll agree.

## Frozen lemon dessert
* 2 eggs
* 2 medium lemons (to make about 3/4 cup juice)
* 2 teaspoons lemon zest
* 2/3 cup sugar
* 2 tablespoons cornstarch
* 2 tablespoons water
* 1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs
* 1 tablespoon melted butter
* 1/2 pint whipping cream

Blend the eggs, lemon juice, and lemon zest in blender to be sure it is smooth. Add sugar and
put in double boiler. Cook, stirring continuously with a rubber spatula, on medium heat until it
starts to thicken.

Then add the cornstarch which has been mixed with the water. Stir at least 3 minutes until thick.
Remove from heat and let cool.

Mix the butter with the cracker crumbs. Put 1 cup of crumbs into bottom of freezer pan (reserve
1/2 cup for the topping). When lemon mixture has cooled, fold in the whipped cream and pour
on top of the crumbs. Sprinkle the rest of crumbs on the top.

Place in the freezer until well frozen. Overnight is best.

Just before serving, take out of the freezer and let set a few minutes. Cut into squares and serve
with a dollop of whipped cream. Serves 6 to 8.
