# Hawaiian Orange Cookies - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

The holidays seem to be a time when we make extra cookies and treats, at least I do. It's good to
have some on hand when family and friends drop in.
I've had this recipe for many years, at least 35 or more. It's a soft cookie and freezes well. In
fact you can make it ahead and have the dough in the freezer to pull out at a minute's notice.

The use of orange zest gives it a unique flavor. With oranges at their peak, and so plentiful in
the stores right now, it makes sense to get the most use out of them. This recipe makes about 3
dozen, but can be easily doubled.

## Hawaiian Orange Cookies
* 1/4 cup butter
* 1/4 cup vegetable shortening
* 3/4 cup white sugar
* 1/4 cup brown sugar
* 1 egg
* 1/2 teaspoon lemon extract
* 1 tablespoon grated orange rind
* 1 cup flaked coconut
* 1 1/2 cups flour
* 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* Another 1/4 cup sugar for topping

Cream butter, shortening and sugars until fluffy. Add egg, extract, orange zest and coconut. Sift
flour, baking powder and salt together and add to creamed mixture. This is best done by hand as
the dough will be very stiff.

Shape dough into 2 rolls, approximately 2 inch x 5 inch on waxed paper. You may need to add
a little flour to the surface. Wrap tightly in a plastic wrap and put in freezer.

Next day, or when you want fresh cookies, preheat oven to 375Â°, cut dough in 1/4-inch slices,
dip in granulated sugar and place on greased cookie sheet. Bake for 7 to 8 minutes. Store in air-
tight container.
