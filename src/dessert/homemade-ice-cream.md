# Homemade Ice Cream - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

In my teenage years at home, one of our family treats was making homemade ice cream.
My dad milked a few cows, about 20 or so as I remember. Ice cream making took some
advance planning. Early in the morning, before the milk truck came to pick up the 10-gallon
cans of milk, my mother would send me out to the metal tank where the cans were kept in cold
water, cooling from the milking the night before. It was my job to dip into the cans and scoop
up at least 3 or 4 cups of cream from each can. (I've often wondered how the butterfat content
tested, if the creamery in Caldwell took a sampling every day).

We had a 6-quart White Mountain Ice Cream Freezer, one that had to be turned by hand, and
we had plenty of hands available. There was no place in our little town where we could get a
block of ice, so someone had to make the trip to Greenleaf, about 10 miles away to get the ice
from a cold storage unit.
The ice was put in a gunnysack and my four brothers took turns bashing it into small pieces
with the backside of an ax.

We made ice cream often during the summer. When the fruit was on, Mother would put in fresh
peaches, cherries, or berries. Sometimes she splurged and bought bananas or pineapple. She had
two different recipes that she used. For one she made custard with lots of eggs, but after she
discovered Junket Rennet Tablets, that became her favorite.

Once the milk and cream mixture was poured into the inside metal can for freezing, ice was
packed around it, covered with handfuls of rock salt to help it freeze, and the job of turning the
crank began. Everybody took a turn at that. We had to turn the crank 100 times before we could
stop and let the next person have at it. Of course, someone had to sit on top of the freezer to
keep it steady. That was my little sister's job. We knew the ice cream was done when you could
not move the crank at all. We could not wait two hours for it to harden up like the recipe
suggested! Nowadays, many people have electric freezers. So, for Dairy Month, what better
way to celebrate than with a heaping dish of this old-fashioned treat!

## Homemade  Ice Cream (1 Gallon)
Dissolve 6 Rennet tablets in 1/4 cup cold water. Set aside.

Combine the following in a saucepan:
* 2 quarts milk (whole milk makes it creamier)
* 2 2/3 cups heavy cream
* 2 2/3 cups sugar
* 2 Tablespoons plus
* 2 teaspoons vanilla

Heat while stirring to lukewarm (110 degrees). Stir in the dissolved Rennet t ablets and quickly
pour into the freezing container of the ice cream maker. Let stand UNDISTURBED for 10
minutes and then cool to room temperature (or you can put it in the ref rigerator). Follow the
freezing procedure recommended by the manuf acturer of your ice cream maker. Don't forget
the ice and the rock salt PD
