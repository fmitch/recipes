# Analaine's Home Cooking: Hot Cocoa Mix
A cup of hot chocolate is a staple for a lot of families that live in a cold-weather country. It's a
drink that warms you clear thru, whether you have been out doing chores or playing in the
snow.

I make up a batch of this for grandkids away at college, and of course keep some on hand. I
think it tastes better being homemade. You may be surprised at the addition of pudding mix, but
it does give it a little more body. Store it in an air-tight container in a cool dry place, and it will
keep for up to 6 months...but it never lasts that long.

## Hot Cocoa Mix
* 2 1/4 cups nonfat dry milk powder
* 2 1/4 cups powdered non-dairy creamer
* 1 cup confectioner's sugar
* 1 pkg. (3 oz) instant chocolate pudding mix
* 3/4 cup baking cocoa (more if you like more chocolate)

In a large bowl sift all of the ingredients together. Put into your storage container. To prepare
hot cocoa: Put 2 heaping TB of the mix in a mug. Add boiling water and stir until blended. A
dollop of whipped cream on top is yummy, or put some marshmallows on top and pop it in the
microwave for a few seconds. You can also sprinkle a bit of cinnamon sugar for a change, or
stir with a peppermint candy cane. Enjoy!
