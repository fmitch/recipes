# Idaho Apple Pudding - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

My dad was an apple farmer. Although we lived on the western boundary of Idaho, he shipped
his apples to Yakima, Washington, and they were sold under a Yakima brand.
There were always extra apples that didn't make the No. 1 grade, and he would pick those up at
the packing shed and bring them home.
The culls, of course, he fed to the pigs, but there would be bins of No. 2's with just a slight
blemish.
These he sold to friends and neighbors for just a pittance, and gave away dozens of boxes to
needy families. My mother would put apples in everything she could think of.

You should try adding an apple or two next time you make stuffing for your turkey. This recipe
is one of my mother's and I think you will like it.

It's best to mix it by hand after you have creamed the butter, sugar and egg. It's really too stiff to
do it in a mixer. The caramel topping is wonderful with it. This makes a small, 8"x8" dish, but
is easily doubled if you want more.

## Idaho apple pudding
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 1/4 cup butter
* 2 TB vegetable oil
* 1 egg
* 1/2 T salt
* 2 cups chopped apples
* 1 cup flour
* 1 T soda
* 1 T cinnamon
* 1/2 T nutmeg
* 1/2 cup nuts (optional)
* 1/2 cup raisins (optional)

Cream sugar and butter until fluffy. Beat in egg and oil. Sift dry ingredients
together. Add to mixture and stir by hand. Add chopped apples. Batter will be very stiff. Put
into a greased 8"x8" Pyrex pan. Bake at 325Â°F for 30 minutes. Make topping while it is baking.

### Topping
Caramelize 1/2 cup sugar. Watch closely so it doesn't burn. Add 1 cup water and
another 1/2 cup sugar. Mix 2 TB cornstarch in 1/2 cup water. Add to boiling mixture to thicken.
Then add 1/2 cup milk or cream and a pinch of salt. Serve warm over apple pudding.
