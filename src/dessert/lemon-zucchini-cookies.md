# Analaine's Home Cooking: Lemon-zucchini cookies
The zucchini is on, and here's another way to use that prolific vegetable. My quilting friend,
Iona Hummell, brought a big platter of these cookies to a potluck last summer, and they went
like hotcakes.

If your zucchini is quite young and tender you may want to leave the peeling on. Otherwise I
would peel them, and remove any large seeds.
You can't really taste the zucchini at all, because the lemon is the predominant flavor. This
makes a soft, buttery cookie, and with the lemon frosting it is a delightful change.

Lemon-zucchini cookies
* 3/4 cup butter, room temperature
* 3/4 cup sugar
* 1 T finely grated lemon peel
* 1 cup grated zucchini
* 2 cups flour
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

Frosting:
* 1 cup powdered sugar
* 2 T (or more) fresh lemon juice

### Directions
Cream together butter and sugar. Beat in egg, then lemon zest. Sift flour with salt and baking
powder. Add to creamed mixture until smooth, then blend in zucchini and nuts.

Drop onto greased cookie sheet. Bake in preheated oven at 375Â° F for 12 to 15 minutes.
Cookies brown only slightly. Remove from pan, and while still warm, drizzle with lemon
frosting. Makes approximately 3 dozen cookies.
