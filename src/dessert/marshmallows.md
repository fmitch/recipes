# Marshmallows - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

I was in high school when we received a Christmas package from my Aunt Lois, who lived 400
miles away. Tucked in with the presents was a batch of candy â€” homemade marshmallows!
She included the recipe and we promptly tried it out.
My mother had just started using a new Kitchen-Aid mixer, so it was perfect for this. We've
made these hundreds of times in the 60-plus years since then.

It's a great family activity to cut and roll these in all kinds of toppings: powdered sugar, graham
cracker crumbs, coconut, toasted coconut, chopped nuts, dipping chocolate or melted chocolate
chips. We've cut them in larger pieces and made like a Rocky Road candy bar. My personal
favorite is toasted coconut.

Every year about this time I get a call from one or more of the grandkids saying, "Grandma, I
can't find the marshmallow recipe! Can you give it to me again?" It's a favorite of Sharon's and
Roger's families. They make plates of these to give out for Christmas treats and to take as they
go caroling. What a great tradition!

## Marshmallows
* 3 packages Knox gelatin
* 1 cup water
* 2 cups sugar
* 1 1/2 cups white Karo
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon vanilla

In a small bowl mix the gelatin with 1/3 cup water, then add 1/3 cup boiling water. Mix well.
Put 1/3 cup water in saucepan and bring to a boil. Add 2 cups sugar, stirring constantly until it
comes to a boil. Then add 1 1/2 cups Karo and 1/4 teaspoon salt.

Mix well, then dump into large mixing bowl, add the gelatin mixture and blend together. Let it
sit until lukewarm. Mix on low speed to begin with, add vanilla and beat on high until peaks
form and it will hold its shape. Grease a large cookie sheet (I use a 12" x 17").

With a rubber spatula spread the marshmallow stuff onto the cookie sheet. Put in fridge for an
hour or so to set . Cut with a knife dipped in a jar water. Roll in your favorite toppings. Enjoy!
