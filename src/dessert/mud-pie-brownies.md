# Analaine's Home Cooking: Mud Pie Brownies
My thirteen-year-old grandson, Nate, is a Life Scout, working on his Eagle. He has signed up to
attend the National Boy Scout Jamboree next June to be held in West Virginia.
In order to get there he needs to raise a lot of money. He has several fund-raising projects going
on to accomplish that goal.

Currently he is putting together a cookbook for outdoor cooking â€“ recipes that any scout or
camper could easily make. He has gathered ideas from family and friends everywhere and has
quite a collection ready to print.

These Mud Pie Brownies can be partly assembled at home, and your kids can easily make them
at your next campout. While they may not be as good as the traditional brownies baked at
home, they do satisfy the craving for something sweet, and the young campers will love making
them.

## Mud Pie Brownies
In a quart freezer bag, put:
* 1 package of graham cracker crumbs (already crumbled, about 1 1/2 cups)
* 1/4 cup (or more) of broken nuts: walnuts, pecans, hazelnuts, peanuts, etc.
* 3 TB. powdered sugar
* In a second bag, put:
* 3/4 cup chocolate chips
* 1/4 cup hot chocolate mix

At camp:
* Add 1/4 cup water to the chocolate
* Bring a pot of water to a boil and dip the bag in it to melt the chocolate.
* When melted, add the graham cracker crumb mixture, and knead to mix thoroughly.
* Pour out onto a plate and let cool.Then cut or break into chunks. Divide among the campers.

Enjoy!
