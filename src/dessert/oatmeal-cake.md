# Oatmeal Cake - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

My recipe filing system out-grew the small metal box I started out with years ago.
Now my recipes are crammed together in a sturdy shoebox I covered with bright contact paper.
The old pink 3x5 card filed under "Cakes" is dated 1963-Oregon City. It's a bit grimy with
fingerprints on it and what looks like may be some cake batter smudges as well. That's a sign of
a real treasure that has been much used and loved.

One year during the Christmas season, our family (with four young children) was invited to
spend an evening with my husband's boss. His wife, Ruth Bryant, was head of the Good
Samaritan School of Nursing in Portland, Oregon, but her hobby was cooking. She served this
hot oatmeal cake and my boys embarrassed me by asking for seconds and more. So of course, I
had to have the recipe.

I think Ruth was a little generous with the topping, but my family all agree it is the absolute
BEST way in the world to have oatmeal. It is still what Sharon requests for her birthday, and
yes, she wants it for breakfast!

It's best piping hot right out of the oven with a glass of cold milk. I've also served it for a special
brunch and as a dinner dessert with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. PD

## Oatmeal Cake
* 1-1/2 c water
* 1 c quick oats
* 1 c white sugar
* 1 c brown sugar
* 1 stick of butter
* 2 eggs
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 2 c flour (part whole wheat, optional)
* 1 tsp backing power
* 1 tsp soda
* 1 tsp cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp nutmeg
* 1/4 tsp cloves

Boil 1-1/2 c. water in saucepan and add 1 c. quick oatmeal. Stir and set off heat to cool.

With a mixer, combine: 1 c. white sugar, 1 c. brown sugar, 1 cube of butter and beat well. To
the well-beaten mixture add: 2 eggs, 1 tsp. vanilla and oatmeal mixture.

Sift together: 2 c. fl our (sometimes I use part whole wheat), 1 tsp. baking powder, 1 tsp. soda, 1
tsp. cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. each of nutmeg and cloves. Add to the oatmeal mixture and stir
together gently.

Pour batter into greased and floured 9x13 Pyrex pan. Bake for 30 minutes @ 325.

## Topping
* 1 c brown sugar
* 1/4 c milk
* 1 stick butter
* 1 c coconut
* 1 c chopped nuts

While the cake is baking, make the topping. In a saucepan, mix: 1 c. brown sugar, 1/4 c. white
sugar, 1/4 c. milk and 1 cube butter. Boil hard for 1 minute. 

Take off stove and add 1 c. coconut
and 1 c. chopped nuts.

When cake is done, cut some slits in it with a sharp knife or poke with large fork and pour
topping mixture over it. Put back in oven and broil for just 1 minute. Watch carefully as it will
brown fast. (I leave the door ajar to watch.)
