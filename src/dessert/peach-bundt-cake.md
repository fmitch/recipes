# Peach Bundt Cake - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

I got this recipe from one of my son's college buddies back in the 1980's. Although Mark
majored in accounting, he has become quite a chef in his own right. One of my favorite recipes
is his Provincial Pot Roast. I'll send that along later this year — it's the perfect meal for a crisp
autumn day.

This cake, however, is good any time. Mark used a 15-ounce can of peaches, but since I do my
own canning I open a quart bottle and use half of it. This can also be used with a small can of
fruit cocktail; they both make a really moist cake. He beat the peaches in with the creamed
mixture, but I find it easier to whip them up in the blender. I think it makes for a smoother
batter.

## Peach Bundt Cake
* 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
* 1 can (15 ounces) peaches
* 1 1/2 cups sugar
* 1/2 cup vegetable shortening
* 3 eggs
* 1 teaspoon vanilla
* 2 1/2 cups flour
* 3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon soda
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 3/4 teaspoon salt

In a small bowl combine the cinnamon and sugar. Spray a bundt pan with cooking oil and
sprinkle the sugar mixture over bottom and sides of pan.

In a large mixing bowl, cream the sugar and shortening. Add eggs and vanilla and beat until
smooth. Add the peaches and mix well.

Sift together the dry ingredients and add to the peach mixture. Pour into the bundt pan. Bake at
* 335° for 45 minutes, or until the cake tests done. (350° is a little too hot.)

Remove from oven and cool completely. Loosen edges of cake with a knife. Cover with a
serving platter and invert the cake to remove from pan. This doesn't really need an icing.
