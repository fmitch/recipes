# Analaine's Home Cooking: Pineapple-Zucchini Bread
For as long as I can remember I have made zucchini bread. It's just the thing I do when the
zucchini is on. I also freeze some in 2-cup packages to make throughout the year. One day my
friend, Iona, brought a loaf of hers to our quilting group, and it had to be the best I had ever
tasted.

It was so much more moist than mine. I was surprised at the amount of baking powder, soda,
and cinnamon. It was twice what I use, but the result was wonderful. She also used almond
extract instead of vanilla, along with butter flavoring. The addition of pineapple makes the
batter seem a little thin, but it works. I think you'll be pleased with this recipe.

## Pineapple-Zucchini Bread
* 2 cups white flour
* 1 cup whole wheat flour
* 3 tsp. cinnamon
* 1 1/2 tsp. soda
* 1 tsp. salt
* 3 eggs
* 2 cups sugar
* 1 cup oil
* 2 cups shredded zucchini
* 1 oz. can of crushed pineapple, with juice
* 1/2 tsp. almond extract
* 1/2 tsp. butter flavoring
* 1 cup chopped nuts (optional)

Sift dry ingredients together and set aside. In large mixing bowl beat the eggs until light and
fluffy. Gradually add the sugar, then the oil and flavorings. Mix in the dry ingredients, then add
the zucchini, pineapple and nuts slowly, or by hand. Batter will seem thinner than usual. Put
into 2 regular (or 3 medium) loaf pans that have been greased and fl oured. Bake at 350Â° for
about 55 minutes. Check for doneness with a toothpick at 50 minutes.
