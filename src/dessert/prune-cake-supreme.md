# Prune Cake Supreme - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

When I was in high school, I worked at a packing shed when the prunes were on. I like them
fresh, dried, or even canned, but best of all in a prune cake. Last week I picked a bucket of ripe,
juicy, Italian prunes and could hardly wait to make my Prune Cake Supreme, a recipe I coaxed
out of a dear friend, Clarissa Burr, from Homedale, Idaho.

She is long-since deceased, but I think of her every fall when I make this yummy treat. It has
become a favorite of my family. Remember though, the prunes need to be quite ripe, green ones
hardly fill the bill. If you have canned prunes on hand, they will do. Just be sure to cut them in
small chunks. No need to boil them, just use the prunes and 1 cup of the rich thick juice. Aunt
Helen's Caramel Frosting really tops this off.

## Prune Cake Supreme
Boil together: 
* 2 cups of pitted, diced prunes
* 1 cup water 
* 1/2 c. sugar. 

Boil for a couple of minutes then set off stove to cool.

Cream together: 
* 1 1/2 cups sugar
* 3 eggs
* 1 tsp vanilla 
* slowly add 1 cup oil 
Continue beating until well mixed.

In another bowl, sift together: 
* 2 1/2 cups flour (sometimes I use half whole wheat)
* 1 1/4 tsp baking soda
* 1 tsp salt (scant)
* 1 tsp cinnamon
* 1 tsp nutmeg
* 1/2 tsp cloves

Add dry ingredients to wet, then add 
* 1 cup chopped nuts 
* 1/2 cup raisins. 

Bake in a greased 9x13 Pyrex pan @ 325 for 40 to 45 minutes.

## Aunt Helen's Caramel Frosting
* 2 Tbsp sugar
* 1/4 cup water
* 2 Tbsp butter
* 2 Tbsp cream or canned milk
* 1/4 tsp vanilla
* 1 lb powdered sugar

In a small pan put 2 tbsp sugar, and heat on medium-high until it turns a golden brown. Stir
continually so it doesn't burn. Then add 1/4 cup water and let it boil for another minute or 2.
Remove from heat and let it cool until lukewarm. Add 2 tbsp butter, 2 tbsp cream or canned
milk and just 1/4 tsp vanilla. Gradually add 1 lb powdered sugar, beating with a small hand
mixer. Enjoy!
