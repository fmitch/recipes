# Pumpkin Bars - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

Even though Halloween has come and gone, there's still plenty of pumpkin around. The grocery
stores will keep their shelves stocked with canned pumpkin thru the holidays. I've even cooked
up some from the pumpkins in my garden.

We all know that pumpkin pie is a standard American treat for Thanksgiving or any fall event,
but these pumpkin bars are a nice variation. They are easy to make and can be eaten without a
fork. They are a nice addition to a table full of holiday treats.

## Pumpkin bars
* 1 cup salad oil
* 2 cups flour
* 1 3/4 cups sugar
* 2 teaspoons cinnamon
* 1 teaspoon vanilla
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 2 cups pumpkin
* 4 eggs
* 1 teaspoon soda

Blend salad oil, sugar and vanilla. Add eggs one at a time and beat well. Then add remaining
ingredients and mix together well. Grease and flour a jelly roll pan (12x17) and pour batter into
it. Bake at 350 Â° for 20-25 minutes until done.

Frost with icing when cool: 4 ounces cream cheese, 2 tablespoons milk, 2 tablespoons butter, 1
teaspoon vanilla and 2 cups powdered sugar.

Cream butter, cream cheese, milk and vanilla well. Add powdered sugar. Beat until smooth. Put
on pumpkin bars when they have cooled.
