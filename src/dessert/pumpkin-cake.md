# Pumpkin Cake - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

While pumpkin pie is traditional for Thanksgiving, there's no reason we can't enjoy the rich,
hearty goodness of pumpkin throughout the entire holiday season. This recipe has been in my
file for years ... it's one of those that came from a friend of a friend.

My family thinks it's even better than the standard pumpkin pie. Try it, you may too. It is easier
to make than pie.

I've also substituted regular condensed milk, and added 1/2 cup more sugar when I didn't have
the sweetened condensed milk on hand. It's also best if it's made the day before serving, so that
will take some pressure off of your party day. It's loaded with calories, so eat slowly while you
enjoy every bite.

## Recipe

* 1 large can (29 ounces) pumpkin
* 1 can Eagle Brand sweetened condensed milk
* 3 eggs
* 3/4 cup sugar
* 1 teaspoon cinnamon
* 1 teaspoon nutmeg
* 1/4 teaspoon cloves
* 1/2 teaspoon salt

Beat eggs, add sugar and beat well, then add the rest of the ingredients and mix well. Spread
into a greased 9x13 pan.

Then sprinkle 1 package of yellow cake mix (dry) over the top. Next, sprinkle 1 cup coarsely
chopped walnuts over the cake mix. Then melt 1 cube of butter and drizzle that over the top.

Bake at 350° (or 325° if using Pyrex pan) for approximately 45 to 50 minutes. Cool and cut into
squares. Serve with whipped cream. Makes 12 to 15 servings.
