# Pumpkin Roll - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

It's pumpkin season, and there are other ways to use this hearty vegetable than just in pumpkin
pie...although that is very traditional. This dessert treat is one you can keep for days in the
refrigerator (if it lasts that long). I've seen recipes that call for baking powder, and others that
call for soda. I've tried it both ways, and don't see any difference in the end result. This one
came from Sylvia Lyons, who worked 30 years ago in the Food Department at Brigham Young
University. I think it's a good one.

## Pumpkin Roll
* 3 beaten eggs
* 1 tsp. baking powder (or soda)
* 1 cup sugar
* 2 tsp. cinnamon
* 2/3 cup pumpkin
* 1 tsp. ginger
* 1 tsp. lemon juice
* 1/2 tsp. nutmeg or vanilla
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 3/4 cup fl our

Filling: 
* 1 (8 oz) pkg. cream cheese
* 4 TB butter
* 1 cup powdered sugar
* 1/2 tsp. vanilla

In a large bowl, beat eggs, gradually add sugar slowly. When light and frothy, add the pumpkin
and lemon juice. Sift together the dry ingredients and fold into egg mixture. Spread the batter
into a 10"x15" jelly-roll pan that has been greased and lined with waxed paper. (I use parchment
paper).

Bake at 350Â° for 15 min. Remove from oven. Cool for 15 min., then turn out onto flour sack
towel sprinkled with powdered sugar. Remove wax paper and any crusty edges. Cool 10 min.
longer. From 10-inch side roll up cake in towel. Set aside. Beat together all ingredients for
filling. Unroll cake. Evenly spread filling over cake. Roll up cake (remove towel). Wrap in
plastic wrap. Chill at least 1 hour. Slice before serving.
