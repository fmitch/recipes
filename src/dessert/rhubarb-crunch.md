# Analaine's Home Cooking: Rhubarb Crunch
The rhubarb is on... a sure sign of spring around here.
I cut some yesterday and made this luscious rhubarb crunch. It's a change from pie, but makes a
nice dessert.

However, it doesn't keep well – the bottom crust seems to get a little soggy, so you will want to
use it right away. I make it with at least half whole wheat flour, I think it adds a depth of flavor.

Besides, I use whole wheat whenever I can. Because my mother always added a little red color
to rhubarb, I do too. I think it's a little pale without it.

## Rhubarb Crunch
* 1 cup brown sugar
* 1 cup flour
* 3/4 cup quick oats
* 1/2 cup melted butter
* 1 tsp. cinnamon
* 1/2 cup chopped nuts
* 3/4 to 1 cup sugar
* 1 cup water
* 3 TB cornstarch
* 4 cup rhubarb, raw, diced
* 3 or 4 drops red food coloring
* 1 tsp. vanilla

Mix first 6 ingredients until crumbly. Press half of this mixture into a greased 8x8 pan. Cook
sugar, water, and cornstarch until thick and clear. Add food coloring, vanilla, and the diced
rhubarb.

Pour over the crumb mixture in the pan, then add the rest of the crumbly mixture over the top
and pat lightly. Bake in 350° oven for 45-50 minutes until bubbly around the edges. Serve with
whipped cream if desired.
