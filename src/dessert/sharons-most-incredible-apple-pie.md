# Sharon's Most Incredible Apple Pie - AHC

For the past 20 years my daughter, Sharon, has worked on making the perfect pie, admitting to
trying over 50 diff erent recipes. She has used an idea here, a suggestion there, and some more
trial tests until finally coming up with the best apple pie I've ever tasted!

Sharon has agreed to share her secrets. The first thing is to use at least 3 different varieties of
apples. She prefers 2 Granny Smiths, 2 Jonathans, and 2 Empires (when she is lucky enough to
find them.) Romes are good, but Gravensteins are too mushy. She claims the combination of the
different flavors is what makes the end result so incredible.

The other secret is to briefly cook the apples in apple cider, with the spices and brown sugar
(not white) and then remove the apples and thicken the cider mixture. Sometimes she makes
some extra sauce to pour over the pie (or maybe some ice cream).

## Sharon's Most Incredible Apple Pie
* 6 or 7 apples
* 3/4 cup brown sugar
* 1 cup apple cider
* 1/4 tsp salt.
* 4 Tbsp cornstarch
* 2 Tbsp lemon juice
* 1 tsp cinnamon
* 1/2 tsp nutmeg
* Dash of ground cloves

Core and peel apples. Slice making about 6 cups. Heat apple cider, sugar, and salt to boiling.
Add apples. Cover and simmer until apples are barely tender. Drain and measure liquid. Add
extra cider if necessary to make 1 1/2 c. liquid. Blend liquid with cornstarch, lemon juice,
cinnamon, nutmeg and ground cloves.

Simmer until thickened. Then add 2 Tbsp butter. Add apples and turn into unbaked pie shell.
Put a top on it. Bake in hot oven @ 425 for 20-25 min.

This pie is best warm.
