# Analaine's Home Cooking: Snicker Bar Dessert
The ladies from my local church meet together for a potluck once a month. We are called "The
Lunch Bunch," and everyone is invited. Sometimes there are only 10 there, other times 20 or
more. It's a fun way to enjoy someone else's cooking and to taste a variety of dishes.

This Snicker Bar Dessert was really a winner one month. It was sweet and gooey with a tart,
crunchy texture, but also a taste of caramel and nuts. I couldn't figure it out. With gentle
coaxing, Shelley gave us the recipe. It's so easy you can't believe it. She was quite insistent that
you use a really tart apple, like Granny Smith. It gives a nice contrast with sweet and sour.
Others will just be too sweet. I've found this to be true. If you are serving a crowd, you will
want to double this.

## The Recipe
* 1 large pkg. instant Vanilla Pudding
* 2 1/2 c. milk (not 3 as it says on the box)
* 1/2 pint (or more) of whipped cream.
* 1 large Granny Smith apple, diced very fine. Peel if you like, or leave peelings on
* 3 Snickers Bars, chopped up

Mix milk with the pudding. Let set while you whip the cream, sweeten lightly.

Add apple and Snickers Bars. Fold in the whipped cream. Serve in a pretty glass dish and enjoy!
