# Spudnuts - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

The cool crisp nights of autumn make me think of apple cider and doughnuts. As a young
college student I had my first taste of a new delicacy called "Spudnuts." There was a shop on
South State Street in Salt Lake City that was the rage then.

When anyone got to the big city they would buy 2 or 3 dozen and share them with roommates
and friends. They were light and wonderful and would melt in your mouth, so much better than
the crumbly cake doughnut. They were best when they were warm and dripping with glaze. I've
often wondered why they seemed to fade from the market.

Luckily, Krispy Kreme has arrived. It seems to me that the old-fashioned spudnuts have made a
comeback. This recipe is in my old green cookbook, and it's pretty close to spudnuts as I
remember them. They do take awhile to make, so allow plenty of time. You may want to cut
this recipe in half.

Why the name spudnuts? It's because of the mashed potatoes. Idahoans will recognize that.

## Spudnuts
* 3 cups milk, scalded
* 2 tablespoons yeast
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 4 tablespoons butter
* 1 cup cooked, mashed potatoes
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 2 large beaten eggs
* 2 teaspoons salt
* 6 cups flour, plus more as needed

Take out 1 cup of the hot milk. Let it cool to lukewarm. Then add yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar to
it. Let this mixture sit for a few minutes to dissolve yeast.

To the other 2 cups of hot milk, add butter, sugar, mashed potatoes and salt. When lukewarm
add the beaten eggs, the yeast mixture and flour. Mix well and then knead. Put in oiled bowl.
Cover with dishtowel. Let rise twice.
Take half of the dough and roll out on floured counter to 1/4 inch thick. Cut with doughnut
cutter. (I use a cottage cheese container to make a bigger doughnut.) Let them rise again, at least
30 min or so. Fry in hot oil @ 350.

Yield: 4 or 5 dozen, depending on size. Dip one side in glaze made with 1 pound powdered
sugar, 2 tablespoons butter and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Add hot water to ingredients a little at a time
until a thin consistency is obtained.
