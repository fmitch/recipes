# Steamed Christmas Pudding - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

My maternal grandparents were English, and holiday dinners always remind me of them. I
never did care for the Yorkshire pudding at Thanksgiving, but the carrot suet pudding at
Christmastime was a real treat. Grandma never made pie or cake for dessert, always this
pudding.

My mother used to make it as well, especially in the fall after Dad would butcher a beef and
suet was plentiful. Now-a-days I use butter instead. Mother also added apples to Grandma's
recipe. It is best served hot with a sauce of some kind â€“ either lemon, orange or caramel.

## Steamed Christmas Pudding
* 1 cup sugar
* 1 cup grated carrots
* 1/2 cup butter
* 1 cup grated potatoes
* 2 large eggs
* 1 cup grated apples
* 1 cup flour
* 1 cup raisins
* 2 tsp. baking powder
* 1 cup chopped nuts
* 1/2 tsp. soda
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 2 cups dry bread crumbs
* 1 cup candied fruit mix
* 1 tsp. nutmeg (optional)
* 1 tsp. cinnamon
* 1/2 tsp. cloves

Cream butter and sugar. Add eggs one at a time and beat well. Remove from mixer and add the
rest of the ingredients by hand. Batter will be very thick. Add carrots, potatoes and apples first,
then the bread crumbs, raisins, nuts. Sift dry ingredients together, adding them last. Years ago
we used to cook this in a metal shortening can (a large coffee can will do). I use 3 wide-mouth
quart jars that have been generously sprayed with a cooking spray. Fill the jars no more than 2/3
full, as the pudding expands. Cover and steam in a large stock pot for 2 hours.
