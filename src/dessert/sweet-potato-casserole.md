# Analaine's Home Cooking: Sweet Potato Casserole
My grandson, Colin, was married at Thanksgiving time last year and the bride's family hosted a
huge Thanksgiving dinner for over 60 people. It was served buffet style and the tables were
absolutely loaded. Turkey and dressing, hams, fried shrimp, baked goods of all kinds, salads,
desserts, you name it.

People were lined up for this dish, leaving the pies untouched. I only took a small serving just to
taste it, but believe me, it was the hit of the day. I went back, of course, for more. It's even
better than candied yams if that's possible.

I managed to coax the recipe out of the bride's sister. She had come from Tennessee and
brought the recipe with her – along with lots of pecans. I think she must have doubled the
amount of nuts.

I've made this dish with walnuts or hazelnuts because I have easy access to them. Also, I like
the darker-colored yams. That's just a personal preference. Sometimes I put the marshmallows
on top of the nuts.

This is better served hot, along with meat. With sweet potatoes in the markets year-round,
there's no reason to eat them only at Thanksgiving.

## The Recipe
* 6 or 7 cups mashed, cooked sweet potatoes
* 1/2 cup half & half cream (or canned milk)
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 1 tablespoon honey, molasses, or dark Karo
* 1 teaspoon vanilla
* 1 teaspoon cinnamon
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 2 eggs (beaten)
* 1 cup flaked coconut
* 1 1/2 cups miniature marshmallows

Topping:
* 1 cup flour (try whole wheat)
* 1/4 cup white sugar
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 1/3 cup butter
* 1 teaspoon cinnamon
* 1 cup chopped nuts

Cook potatoes with skins on – either boil them or bake in oven until done. Then peel and mash.
Put in mixing bowl and add the rest of the ingredients – up to the marshmallows.

Transfer to a greased 9x13 Pyrex dish. Sprinkle with the marshmallows. Mix topping together
with a pastry cutter, and sprinkle on top of marshmallows. Bake at 350° for 40 to 45 minutes
until golden brown.
