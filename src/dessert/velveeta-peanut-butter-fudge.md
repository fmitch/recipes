# Velveeta Peanut Butter Fudge - AHC

Here's a recipe for a Christmas goodie that's a little different from the regular run-of-the-mill
Christmas candies. What??? I can almost hear you saying. Velveeta cheese in a candy recipe? I
couldn't believe it either, when I first saw it, but I was assured it was "way good."

Kate and I decided to try it when the grandkids were here visiting. It's easy to make, and there's
no chance of it not setting up, or going grainy like some candy. I know it sounds strange, but I
think you will be pleasantly surprised with the end result. The grandkids called it "lip-smackin'
de-lish"!

Merry Christmas!

## Velveeta(y) Peanut Butter Fudge
* 1/2 lb Velveeta cheese
* 3/4 c butter
* 2 lb powdered sugar
* 1 Tbsp vanilla
* 1 c peanut butter

Put 1/2 lb. Velveeta cheese in a glass bowl and melt in the microwave - watch carefully so it
doesn't get rubbery. Add: 3/4 c. butter (margarine won't do). Just barely melt it, mix these two
together. Then add: 2 lb. powdered sugar, 1 tbsp vanilla, 1 c. peanut butter (we like the chunky,
but whatever is your preference).

Knead like bread dough. Roll candy on counter (or marble slate) with a heavy rolling pin.
Spread in 9" x 13" Pyrex dish. Refrigerate until set. Cut into small squares. You peanut butter
lovers.... Enjoy
