* 15 oz can black beans, drained and rinsed
* 15 oz can white cannellini beans, drained
* 1 medium onion, chopped
* 15 oz can corn, with juice
* 10 oz can Rotel diced tomatoes with green chilis, with juice
* 1/2 cup chicken broth or stock

## method
1. Place all of your ingredients into the Instant Pot in the following order: chicken, black and white beans, onion, corn with juice, tomatoes, broth.
2. Add chili powder, cumin, and ranch packet. Stir everything to combine, getting some of the juice under the chicken to keep it from scorching.
3. Cut cream cheese into 6 pieces and place on top of chili. 
4. Cover and seal with lid and switch valve to "sealing" position. Cook for 20 minutes on high pressure. Natural release for 10 minutes, then quick release the pressure.

## notes
* Ranch dressing mixes come in differing sizes (0.4 oz to 1.5 oz). It should be enough to make 16 oz of dressing or dip per package instructions.
