# Analaine's Home Cooking: Apple pork chops
It used to be that when I would cook pork chops I would always season them with onion, garlic,
sage, thyme, or maybe poultry seasoning.
That's good, and I like it, but have you ever tried a whole new twist – like apple, brown sugar
and mustard?
I have used mustard with a pork roast in the crock-pot, but here the flavor is a little more subtle.
It's almost like a sweet and sour, but not quite.
My mother would say: "Here's another way to use apples." And sometimes I do use three
instead of two.
Why not? I've even made this with applesauce when I didn't have fresh apples on hand. That
does make a nice "gravy" to go with the chops over rice, or even mashed potatoes.

## Apple pork chops
* 4 pork chops
* 2 apples, peeled and sliced
* 2 TB vegetable oil
* 2 TB brown sugar
* 1/2 cup chopped onions
* 2 TB flour
* 1/2 T salt
* 3/4 T ground mustard
* ground black pepper to taste
* 1/2 T ground cloves
* 1 1/2 cup water
* 1 TB apple cider vinegar

Preheat oven to 350°F. Heat oil on medium-low in a large skillet. Sauté onion for 1
minute or so until tender. Remove onion and set aside. Turn the heat up and brown the pork
chops on both sides. Place pork chops in an 8" x 12" baking dish and sprinkle them with salt
and pepper.

Then put the apples, onions, sugar, spices and flour into the frying pan and mix together with
the meat drippings. Add the water and vinegar and bring to a boil. Then pour over the chops.
Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 30-40 minutes. This serves 4.
