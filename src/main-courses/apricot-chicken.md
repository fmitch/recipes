# Analaine's Home Cooking: Apricot Chicken
This recipe is so easy you can't believe it. When my friend gave it to me years ago I was a little
skeptical. "How can that possibly be good?" I thought. But it is! And there are lots of variations
you can make. My niece has a prizewinning recipe that is similar.

She uses apricot jam, the onion soup mix, but Zesty Italian dressing instead of the Catalina. She
also claims that peach jam works just as well. And then there is a combination of plum jam,
onion mix and either Italian, Catalina, or Russian dressing as a glaze/topping for pork chops. If
you go this route, you will want to brown the pork chops first, then bake (uncovered) at 325° for
about 40-45 minutes. It's good served with rice.

## Apricot Chicken
* 1 whole chicken or a package of chicken thighs
* 1 cup apricot jam
* 1 cup Catalina dressing
* 1 pkg. onion soup mix

Remove skin from chicken thighs. Pat dry. Place in a baking dish. No need to salt or
pepper them; there is plenty of seasoning in the soup mix. Mix ingredients in a small bowl.
Brush generously over entire chicken, or spoon on to the chicken pieces. Bake in 9"x13" Pyrex
pan at 325° about 40-45 minutes.
