# Analaine's Home Cooking: Chicken-Avocado Casserole
This recipe came from a cozy little Bed-and-Breakfast in John Day, Oregon. We've had it in our
family for nearly 30 years now. I couldn't believe COOKED avocados, but really, it is very
tasty. Originally it was served with rice on the side, but I have even made it by putting two cups
of cooked rice on top of the avocados, and that made a nice casserole.

If you do this you should add 1/2cup of chicken stock, and another 1/2 of mayo to the sauce. Be
sure the avocados are slightly firm, not too soft. The seasoning of the curry is very subtle, just
the right amount to enhance the flavor. This is a real winner.

## The Recipe
* 4 halved chicken breasts
* l celery stalk with leaves
* l medium-small onion
* l cube chicken bullion
* 3/4 tsp. curry powder
* 1 c. mayo
* 1 can cream of chicken soup
* 1 c. grated cheddar cheese
* 2 avocados, peeled and sliced

In a large pot simmer the chicken in enough water to cover, with celery, onion, salt and pepper.
Remove from stove and cool. De-bone and pull or shred into bite-size pieces. Strain stock and
refrigerate for another use. Place avocado slices in a slightly greased casserole dish. In another
dish combine mayo, soup, bullion and curry. Add chicken. Pour this mixture over the avocados.
Top with grated cheese (I like to use a combination of cheddar and monterey jack). Bake this
dish at 350Â° for 20 minutes or until bubbly.Serve hot. This is enough for 6 to 8.
