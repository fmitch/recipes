# Analaine's Home Cooking: Chicken Casserole
My friend, Vera Reynolds, was a retired Home Ec Teacher at Logan High School. She had a
wealth of wonderful recipes. This is one she gave me years ago, although I've made a few
changes, like adding a little grated carrot for color, or pieces of red or green bell pepper.

She boiled her chicken, but I've also made it with leftover baked chicken. You could use turkey
if you wanted. A whole chicken makes a LOT,and since I don't have a big family to feed
anymore, I make a smaller amount. She used cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soups,
but I like making a white sauce instead, and adding some chicken bouillon. You may be
surprised at the mayo and lemon, but I think you will find it adds a little snap. She topped it
with crushed, buttered corn flakes, but I often leave that off. Be creative. Do what you want to
make this recipe suit your family's tastes.

## The Recipe:
Boil chicken with seasonings: onion, celery, celery leaves, bay leaf, thyme, sage, (or savory),
salt and pepper. Once cooked, remove chicken from bone. Cut into big chunks. Use at least 2 or
3 cups for aserving of 6. Set aside.
