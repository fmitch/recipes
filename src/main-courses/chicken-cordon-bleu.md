# Chicken Cordon Bleu - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

This basic recipe came from my friend, Beth Somers, in Logan, Utah; although I've changed it
so much she wouldn't recognize it. I've made lots of variations over the years and it's good
however you do it.
Beth used medium sharp cheddar cheese, but I prefer a combination of mozzarella, swiss and
monterey jack. They're not as salty as the darker cheddar. I don't salt the chicken at all, as she
did.

I think there is plenty of salt in the ham, cheese and seasoned bread crumbs. Sometimes I add
fresh sauteed mushrooms, or finely cut green onions.
Once in a while I pour some sour cream mixed with cream of chicken (or mushroom) soup over
the chicken during the last 20 minutes of baking. This is tasty, but not as appealing to the eye.

## Chicken Cordon bleu
* 6 medium chicken breasts, skinned and boned
* 6 slices of thinly sliced ham
* 12 slices of thinly sliced cheese
* 1 cup bread crumbs
* 1 teaspoon seasoned salt
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
* 1/2 teaspoon dried sage

Flatten chicken between pieces of plastic to about 1/2" thick. Place cheese on chicken, then ham
and another piece of cheese. Roll up from widest end first.

Secure with a toothpick. Sometimes I dip the chicken in milk or egg first and then roll it in the
seasoned bread crumbs. Place chicken in a greased pan.

Bake uncovered at 400Â° for 20 minutes. Then cover with foil and bake an additional 20 minutes.
Smaller pieces will take less time, so don't over-cook.
