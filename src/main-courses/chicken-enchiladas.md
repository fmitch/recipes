# Analaine's Home Cooking: Chicken Enchiladas

Whenever I cook a chicken - either bake it or boil it - I figure I can get at least 2 meals out of it.
That's because my family is raised and gone, and I'm pretty much alone, except for an
occasional grandchild who visits. I've learned that teenagers really like these chicken
enchiladas. They are nutritious and very filling. I got the basic recipe from my daughter,
Sharon, and have modified it a bit.

If you don't want to cook up a whole chicken, a couple of large chicken breasts will do. I plan
on about 1/2 cup cooked chicken per person. Use whatever cheese you like. I use a combination
of cheddar and monterey jack. I tried it with a garlic cheese once and that was yummy. A
pimento blend would also be good. This recipe will make 6 generous servings.


## The Recipe
* 6 large flour tortillas
* 3 c. cooked chicken, cut into chunks1- 4 oz. can mild green chilies (do you like HOT?)
* 1/2 lb. grated cheese, save some for top
* 1/2 c. diced onion, sauteed
* 1 c. sour cream
* 1/2 pkg. cream cheese, cut into chunks
* 1/2 tsp. lemon pepper

Mix together lightly with a fork, then divide the mixture into 6 parts, spoon mixture into
tortillas, roll up and place open side down into a greased 9x13 pan.

Then mix together and pour over tortillas:
* 1 can cream of chicken soup
* 1 c. evaporated milk
* 1/2 c. chicken broth

Sprinkle with grated cheese on top. Cover loosely with foil. Bake at 350Â° for about 30 min.
(until bubbly around edges). Remove foil and bake for another 5 minutes or so. Serve hot.
