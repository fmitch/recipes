# Chicken Roll-ups - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

My brother Henry, and his wife Grace invited me to accompany them on a trip to Yellowstone
one summer. We were travel-weary when we got to Grace's cousin, Janice Jeppesen, in
Rexburg, Idaho. She had supper waiting for us, and what a treat it was. These chicken roll-ups
were wonderful, served along with a green summer salad. Of course, I had to have the recipe.

I've made this many times over the years. I don't always have the Crescent rolls on hand or go
buy them especially for this dish. I'm a "make-it-from-scratch" kind of person, and have a hunch
there may be other women across the nation the same way. So I have improvised and used pie
dough or biscuit dough rolled very thin for the wrap. They aren't quite like Janice's, but they are
still very tasty.
When I buy a boiling chicken it's usually a big one so I can get two meals out of it - this is one
of them. I have a good chicken casserole I'll send along for another issue.

## Ingredients
* 2 c. cooked chicken, cut up
* 1 large pkg cream cheese, cut in chunks
* 1 small can mushrooms, drained and cut
* 2 med green onions, chopped
* 1 tsp. lemon pepper
* 1/4 c. melted butter
* 1 c. seasoned breadcrumbs
* 1 can Crescent rolls (for 8)

## Method
Unwrap cream cheese and set out to soften. Put in bowl and mix it with fork until it's easy to
add the chicken, mushrooms and onions. This recipe calls for canned mushrooms, but I think it
would be just as good, or better, with fresh ones sauteed in a little butter. Roll out Crescent rolls
(or biscuit dough) until very thin. I use the lid of my 1-quart Revere pan to cut the biscuit
dough.

Put a scant half-cup of chicken mix in the middle of each circle and roll up, tucking the ends
under. Dip in melted butter, then roll in seasoned bread crumbs. Place rolls on greased baking
sheet and bake @ 350 for 20-25 min. I make gravy with chicken broth, a little thickening and
1/4 c. sour cream. Enjoy!
