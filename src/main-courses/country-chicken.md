# Country Chicken - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

There are numerous ways to have fried chicken, and this is one more variation. It's moist and
tender, a little like lemon chicken, with a little different twist. Be careful not to overcook it.
The recipe calls for two chicken breasts, cut in half thru the thick part of the meat, but I find it
easier, quicker, and sometimes cheaper to buy a bag of frozen breasts, or chicken tenders.
This makes a great meal served with new potatoes and peas, along with a tossed salad. I think
you will enjoy it. Serves 4.

## Country Chicken
* 2 tablespoons milk
* 1 egg
* 1/2 cup flour
* 1/2 cup crushed cornflakes
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1/8 teaspoon pepper
* 2 boneless chicken breasts, halved
* 1/4 cup veg. oil
* 1 crushed garlic clove
* 1/4 cup sliced onions or leeks
* 1 lemon
* 1/4 cup sour cream (low fat)
* parsley to garnish

In a small bowl, combine milk and egg. In a 9-inch pie pan combine crushed cornflakes, salt
and pepper (sometimes I use seasoned salt). Flatten each chicken breast by pounding with a pan
between sheets of waxed paper.

Put oil and garlic in a 10-inch skillet on medium heat. When hot, add chicken that has been
dipped in milk and flour mixtures. Cook 2-3 minutes, turning occasionally until golden brown.
Remove chicken to platter, and keep warm. Squeeze slice of lemon on each piece of chicken,
then spread a tablespoon of sour cream on each. Add onions and a bit of parsley to garnish.
