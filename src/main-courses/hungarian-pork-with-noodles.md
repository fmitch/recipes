# Analaine's Home Cooking: Hungarian Pork with Noodles
Over the years when I would cook pork, I usually seasoned it with sage, thyme, salt and pepper.
But when I ran across this recipe I decided to give it a try. It really is a welcome change!
Something about the combination of caraway seeds with the dill, garlic and paprika gives it a
unique flavor.
I've made this using the whole pork chops as well as strips from a pork roast and making it
somewhat like a stroganoff .
If you use the whole pork chop, be sure to cut slits in around the edges so they don't curl. This
dish is delicious served with noodles or steamed rice.

## Hungarian Pork with Noodles
* 6 loin pork chops
* 1 TB. olive oil
* 3 TB. flour
* 1 medium onion, finely chopped
* 1 tsp. caraway seed
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 1 tsp. paprika
* 1/2 tsp. dried dill weed
* 1/4 tsp. garlic powder
* 1 to 2 cups water (and more)
* 1 cup sour cream (or more)

Trim excess fat from pork. Put flour on a plate and pat meat into it, or put in a small
sack and shake meat in it. Heat large skillet over medium heat. When hot, add olive oil and
pork. Brown on both sides.

Remove excess oil. Add onions and spices, then 1 cup water. Cover and continue to cook on
medium-low heat for 30 to 45 minutes, or until the pork is tender. Check often. Add more water
as necessary so the pork doesn't dry out.

When the meat is done, transfer to a warm platter. Then add the sour cream to the meat
drippings and stir to blend. Heat the mixture through, but do not boil. Pour sauce over the pork
chops and noodles. Enjoy!
