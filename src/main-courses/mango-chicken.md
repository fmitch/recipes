# Mango Chicken - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

Seems like I'm always looking for another way to serve chicken. This one is from my friend
Wilma, and was a real hit with my family. The original recipe didn't call for the onion, bell
pepper or pineapple, but I think they complement the mangoes and make it a little more festive.

I don't know if you could call it a true Hawaiian dish, but it's really very tasty. The combination
of red pepper flakes cooked with the coconut milk and soy sauce is the key to the unique flavor.
Be sure you cook those long enough to let the flavors meld together.

## Mango Chicken
* 3 chicken breasts, cut into bite-size pieces
* 1/2 cup flour
salt & pepper
* 2 tablespoons oil
* 1 can coconut milk
* 2 tablespoons brown sugar
* 1 tablespoon soy sauce (more if you like)
* juice of 2 limes
* 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, (more if you like it hotter)
* 1 tablespoon cornstarch
* 1/2 cup onions, cut in 1-inch pieces
* 1 cup pineapple chunks (1 can)
* 1 red or yellow bell pepper, cut in 1-inch chunks
* 2 mangoes, cut up
* 12 cups toasted coconut

Cut chicken into 1-inch cubes. Toss in a little flour. Cook in frying pan on medium heat with
the oil. Brown on both sides, salt and pepper lightly. Remove from pan and set aside.

In the pan, mix the coconut milk, soy sauce, brown sugar, lime juice and crushed red pepper
flakes. Let this cook for at least 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, cut the onions, mangoes and bell peppers. Add the onions, pineapple and chicken to
the milk mixture. Mix the cornstarch with a little water and add it. Gently simmer 2 or 3
minutes.

Then add the mangoes and bell pepper. Only cook another minute so they will still be crisp.
Pour into a serving dish and top with toasted coconut. Serve with rice.
