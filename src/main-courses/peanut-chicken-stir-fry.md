# Peanut-Chicken Stir Fry - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

For as long as I can remember, Chinese cuisine has been a favorite of our family. Whenever we
went out to dinner (which wasn't too often many years ago) we always looked for a respectable
Chinese restaurant. Then I would come home and try to replicate one or more of the dishes.

They probably weren't up to the standard of the master chefs, but they were still very tasty, and
we liked them. I have a good Mandarin Chicken recipe that I'll send along later.

You really do need to buy some sesame oil, as it does make a difference in Chinese cooking.
Peanut oil is also good. I keep hoi sin sauce and fish sauce on hand as well. While this recipe
uses carrots, broccoli, and yams, you could choose sugar snap peas and strips of red bell
peppers. This will serve 6.

## Recipe
* 2 c. uncooked rice
* 1 can chicken broth (14 oz)
* 3 Tb. cornstarch
* 2 Tb. brown sugar
* 2 Tb. lime juice
* 2 Tb. sweet chili sauce
* 4 Tb. creamy peanut butter
* 1 Tb. soy sauce
* 1 1/2 tsp. grated fresh ginger
* 1 Tb. sesame oil
* 1 Tb. peanut or vegetable oil
* 1 1/2 tsp. crushed garlic
* 2 large chicken breasts, skinned, boned & cut in cubes
* 1 c. carrots, sliced
* 1/2 c. chopped celery
* 1/2 c. chopped onion
* 1 c. broccoli florets
* 1/2 c. chopped or sliced bell pepper
* 1/2 c. chopped dry-roasted peanuts

Directions: Cook rice according to package instructions. Whisk together chicken broth and the
next 7 ingredients. Set aside.

Heat oils in a large non-stick skillet or wok. Add garlic and cook only a minute or so. This helps
flavor the oil. Then scoop out garlic and set aside. Turn heat to high, add chicken and stir-fry
about 5 minutes until chicken pieces are browned and no longer pink inside. Set aside.

Then put carrots, celery, and onions into the pan (add more oil if necessary). Reduce heat to
medium, put a lid on pan and steam for 2 min. Then add the chicken broth mixture and the
broccoli, stirring constantly until it thickens. Last of all, add the bell pepper so it won't be
mushy. Garnish with chopped peanuts. Serve with rice.
