# Analaine's Home Cooking: Kate's Peanut Sauce w/ Chicken & Noodles
My granddaughter Kate is becoming quite an excellent cook, due in part by helping her dad in
the kitchen, and being willing to experiment and try new things.

She is really quite creative. This is a dish she "put together" one day with what she had on hand.
It's best with chicken or pork, although she's admitted to using left-over ham. She makes it with
spaghetti noodles, but flat rice pasta is even better.

If you don't have the Chinese hot sauce, you can use red pepper flakes, or cayenne, but go easy,
1/4 tsp. is enough. When you have a craving for something just a little different, but healthy and
filling, this is the dish to try.

## Kate's Peanut Sauce w/ Chicken & Noodles
* 2 large chicken breasts, cut into 1" cubes
* 1/2 pkg. noodles – or any kind of pasta you like
* 1 can (14 oz) chicken broth
* – or –
* 3/4 cup water with 1 chicken bouillon cube
* 1/2 cup peanut butter
* 2 TB honey
* 2 TB brown sugar
* 2 tsp. Chinese hot sauce
* 1 TB minced garlic
* 1 TB ground ginger (fresh is best)
* 1 TB soy sauce
* 1 TB cornstarch in 1/4 c. water
* 1/4 to 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
* 1/4 to 1/2 cup chopped peanuts to garnish
* juice of 1 lime

Dredge chicken cubes in flour. Fry in a little oil on medium heat until no longer pink. Set aside.
Cook noodles according to package instructions. Drain. While noodles are cooking, make the
sauce: Combine the next 8 ingredients. Bring to a boil. Thicken with cornstarch and pour over
chicken, then over the noodles. Top with chopped cilantro, lime juice and peanuts. Serves 4.
