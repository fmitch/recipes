# Analaine's Home Cooking: Savory salmon loaf
Here is another recipe from my old green cookbook. I used to make this often when my kids
were young. It's nutritious and a good way to use the canned salmon I keep in my food storage.
It's easy to make and you can have it on the table in less than an hour. I like to rinse the salmon,
drain it and remove all the fat and bones. It's also interchangeable as a tuna loaf (use 2 cans of
tuna, add a little extra onion, lemon, and pimento if you like).

I've also made this as a souffle. Use 4 eggs (separated) instead of 2. Omit the bread crumbs and
make a white sauce (3 TB. butter, 3 TB flour, 1& 1/2 c. milk).

Beat the whites until stiff and fold them in last. Put into a greased casserole dish and bake at
350 for 30-35 min. Serve hot.

## The Recipe
* 1 can salmon, drained (remove the bones)
* 2 eggs, slightly beaten
* 1/2 c. milk
* 1/2 c. bread crumbs
* 1 TB. lemon juice
* 1 TB. finely chopped onion
* 1 TB chopped parsley
* 1/2 tsp. sage
* 1/2 tsp. salt and dash of pepper

Combine ingredients in the order given. Put into buttered baking dish. Bake in moderate 350Â°
oven for 30-45 min. Serve hot.
