# Slow-cooker Mustard Pork Roast - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

This recipe is one I adapted from a Southern Cooking cookbook. You may be surprised at the
amount of mustard in this, and I suppose you could cut back on it, as I have at times, when I
didn't have that much mustard left in the jar.
But really, one cup is not too much, at least for a 5 lb. roast. I've even cooked it with navy beans
in the bottom of the crock-pot, but that's another story.

The rub is an important part, so don't neglect that. I like this roast best shredded, with the sauce
poured over, and served with rice. You certainly could use pasta or potatoes. It's great on
sandwiches made with big chunks of French bread.

## Slow-cooker Mustard Pork Roast
Mix together for a rub:
* 1/3 cup packed brown sugar
* 2 tsp. salt
* 1 1/2 tsp. onion powder
* 1 1/2 tsp. garlic powder
* 1 1/2 tsp. paprika
* 1/2 tsp. ground red pepper

Rub this all over a 4 to 5 lb. bone-in pork shoulder roast. Place in a lightly greased 6-quart slow
cooker.

Then whisk together:
* 1 cup prepared yellow mustard
* 1/3 cup honey (dark is better)
* 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
* 1 1/2 tsp. Worcestershire sauce
`
Pour mustard mixture over top of roast. Cover and cook on LOW for 8 to 10 hours, or on HIGH
4 to 6 hours, or until meat shreds easily with a fork. Let stand 15 minutes, then shred. Stir in the
sauce. Can be served hot or cold.
