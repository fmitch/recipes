# Analaine's Home Cooking: 30-Minute Minestrone Soup
This recipe is so good... and so easy to make you can hardly believe it. You would think you
would have stood over a hot stove for hours. Not so.

Thirty minutes will do it. If you wanted to go vegetarian, you could leave out the hamburger
and it's still very tasty.

Sometimes I switch the beef bouillon for a tablespoon of beef soup base. Bouillon is salty, so
taste for salt before you add any to this soup. This recipe makes 10-12 servings.

## 30-Minute Minestrone Soup
* 1 lb. (or less) hamburger
* 1 large onion, chopped
* 1 cup celery, chopped
* 2 cans (14 oz .) diced tomatoes
* 2 cans small white beans with juice
* 8 cups beef bouillon
* 2 tsp. Italian seasoning
* 1 tsp. basil
* 1 tsp. minced garlic
* 1 pkg. frozen mixed veggies
* 1 TB ketchup
* 1/4 tsp. (or more) pepper
* 1/2 pkg. spaghetti noodles

Brown the hamburger. Drain off excess fat. Add onions and celery, saute on med-low heat
for 3 or 4 minutes. Then add the rest of the ingredients and bring to boil. Break spaghetti
noodles into small pieces and add to the boiling soup. (Or use any kind of small noodle). Cook
about 10 minutes more until done. Serve piping hot with garlic bread or your favorite
breadsticks.
