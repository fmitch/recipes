# Analaine's Home Cooking: Cheeseburger Chowder
A brisk spring day calls for another soup recipe. This one is full of nutrition (and calories), but
easy to make. It's a take-off of potato soup, and very adaptable. I've also added red and green
peppers to it, or a can of corn when I wanted to stretch it.

The recipe calls for cheddar cheese, but if it's very sharp you may want to cut back on it. I
usually use a blend of a milder cheese, like Monterey Jack and medium. Use the salt sparingly,
as the cheese will be salty. This will easily serve 6 or 8.

## Cheeseburger Chowder
* 1/2 lb. ground beef
* 1 TB. vegetable oil
* 1 cup chopped onion
* 1 cup chopped carrots
* 1 cup chopped celery
* 1/2 tsp. dried basil
* 1/2 tsp. dried parsley
* 1/2 tsp. Italian seasoning
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 1/4 tsp. pepper
* 1 cup water
* 2 cups chicken broth
* 4 to 5 cups cubed potatoes
* 4 TB. butter or margarine
* 4 TB. flour
* 2 cups milk
* 2 cups shredded cheddar
* 1/4 cup sour cream

Put oil into a large pot on medium heat. Cook meat until brown. Add vegetables
and seasonings, then water, broth and potatoes. Bring to a boil, then simmer until potatoes are
tender, about 10 to 12 minutes. In a smaller pan, melt the butter and stir in flour.

Add the milk, stirring until smooth. Gradually add the milk mixture to the soup, stirring
constantly. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to simmer. Stir in the cheese, but do not boil, or it
may curdle. When cheese is melted, add sour cream and heat thru.
