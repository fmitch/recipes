# Analaine's Home Cooking: Lentil Soup
It's cold weather and time for some heart-warming and healthy soups. This basic recipe I've had
for years, and I change it about every time I make it. The original recipe called for bacon, but
I've made it with a little left-over chicken and chicken stock.

My favorite, however, is beef. I boil the bones from left-over roast and add tiny chunks of beef
and some drippings. Sometimes I double the amount of tomatoes. So have fun tweaking this
recipe.

It can also be used for split pea soup by substituting split peas for lentils, ham for bacon, and
omitting tomato sauce, vinegar, and Tabasco sauce. This makes a lot â€“ enough for 10 or more.

## Lentil Soup
* 2 cups lentils, washed
* 1 cup onions, chopped
* 1 cup celery, chopped
* 1 cup carrots, sliced
* 1/2 cup cabbage, finely chopped
* 1 small can tomato sauce
* 8 cups water (or more)
* 2 teaspoons Worcester shire sauce
* 2 teaspoons vinegar
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt
* 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
* 1 teaspoon dried oregano
* 1/2 teaspoon basil
* 3 or 4 drops Tabasco sauce
* 4 slices bacon, chopped or other meat with drippings

Put all ingredients into crock-pot. Place on low setting and cook for 8 hours or
more until done. I've also made this in a stock-pot on top of the stove. Simmer it for 2 or 3
hours on medium-low. It will be done in less time, but the crock-pot is certainly the way to go if
you are going to be gone all day.
