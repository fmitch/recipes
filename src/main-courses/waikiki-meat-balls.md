# Waikiki Meat Balls
From Analaine's Home Cooking

Do you ever feel like you need a little variation from the standard old meatball?
Then this recipe will fit the bill. It came from my long-ago neighbor, June Guymon, in Logan,
Utah. It has a bit of a Hawaiian flair to it, and I think you will like it. It's great served with rice.

## Waikiki meat balls
### Step 1
* 1 1/2 pounds hamburger
* 1/3 cup onion, chopped
* 1/3 cup milk
* 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
* 2/3 cup cracker or bread crumbs
* 1 egg
* 1/4 - 1/2 teaspoon ginger
* 1 tablespoon oil or shortening

Mix together hamburger, onion, crumbs, egg, salt, ginger, and milk. Shape into meatballs. Melt
shortening in large skillet. Brown and cook meatballs. Remove from skillet and keep warm.

Pour excess fat from skillet.

### Step 2
* 2 tablespoons cornstarch
* 1/3 cup vinegar
* 1/2 cup brown sugar, packed
* 1 tablespoon soy sauce
* 1 (13 oz) can pineapple tidbits, drained (reserve juice)
* 1/3 cup green pepper, sliced
Mix cornstarch and brown sugar. Stir in reserved pineapple juice, vinegar, and soy sauce until
smooth. Pour into skillet. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens
and boils. Boil and stir 1 minute. Add meatballs & pineapple. Heat thoroughly, then add the
green pepper. Do not cook it. Serves 6.
