# Copper Pennies Salad - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

It was a teachers' potluck over 50 years ago when Earlene Anderson brought this treat. She was
in her late 50's then, so I'm sure she is long gone, but I treasure her hand-written recipe. I've
made it dozens of times over the years.
It makes a lot, so it's the kind of dish you would like to take to a potluck. It's best served cold.
You should make it a day ahead of time and keep in the refrigerator so the flavors have time to
meld together. I think you'll find it a hit at your next party.

## Copper pennies
* 2 pounds carrots
* 1 green pepper
* 1 medium onion
* 1 can tomato soup
* 1 tablespoon worchestershire sauce
* 2 tablespoons cooking oil
* 3/4 cup sugar (or less)
* 1/2 cup vinegar
* 1 teaspoon prepared mustard

Peel and slice carrots in rounds. Cook in salted water until crisp and firm, not mushy. Drain.
Thinly slice (or dice) the pepper and onion and set aside.

Then heat to boiling the rest of the ingredients. Pour this over the carrots, onion and pepper. Salt
to taste. Put in covered dish (I use a Tupperware with a lid) and put in refrigerator for at least 24
hours.

Serve cold and enjoy the compliments.
