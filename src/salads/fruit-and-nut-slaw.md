# Fruit and Nut Slaw - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

Summertime is the perfect time for salads, especially those that are nutritious, filling, and don't
require cooking in a hot kitchen. This one I've had for over 30 years from Mary Lou Butterfield,
although I've changed it a bit. She used bananas, but I prefer grapes or apples, and leave the
peelings on. Sometimes I add some sliced water chestnuts. They go well with it.

## Fruit and Nut Slaw
* 1 can pineapple tidbits
* 1 can (11 ounces) mandarin oranges
* 1 apple (diced)
* 2 tablespoons lemon juice
* 2 tablespoons sugar
* 3 cups shredded cabbage
* 1 cup diagonally sliced celery
* 1/2 cup chopped nuts
* 1/2 cup raisins
* 1 (8 ounces) carton yogurt-orange or lemon
* 1/4 teaspoon salt

Drain the pineapple, reserving the juice. Mix 2 tablespoons of juice with 2 tablespoons of both
lemon juice and sugar. Toss with the diced apple. Then combine the pineapple, apple, cabbage,
celery, mandarin oranges, nuts and raisins.

Sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt (or omit it entirely if you are on a salt-restricted diet). Add the
yogurt and toss lightly.

Cover and chill. Serves 12 or more.
