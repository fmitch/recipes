# Marinated Cauliflower Salad - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

As a kid growing up I never knew what cauliflower was. I suppose that's because we raised all
the vegetables we ate, and cauliflower wasn't something my parents planted. I was in my late
teens before it was introduced to me.
I've liked it ever since, especially since I learned how nutritious it is. I like it on a relish tray
with a dip, or sliced thin in a tossed salad.
I even like it steamed with a little butter, salt and pepper. My favorite is a creamy cauliflower
soup, with cheese, of course.
For some reason my kids were never fond of it. One of them has said, "If you have to eat
cauliflower, this is the way to do it." Well, it's a nice change. See what you think.

## Marinated cauliflower salad
* 1 medium cauliflower, cut into bite-size pieces
* 4 tablespoons salad oil
* 4 tablespoons lemon juice (or lime)
* 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard (scant)
* 2 cloves mashed garlic (or 1 teaspoon minced)
* 1 medium red (or yellow) pepper
* 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
* 1/2 cup shaved Parmesan cheeseâ€¨(or your preference)

Whisk together the lemon juice, mustard, garlic and oil. Toss with cauliflower in large glass or
plastic bowl. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours.

Stir 2 or 3 times while marinating. Just before serving add the bell pepper and parsley. Season
with salt and pepper if desired.

Top with shaved or grated cheese. This can also be served on a lettuce leaf. Makes enough for a
family.
