# Pasta-Veggie Salad - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

Summer is a great time for salads, so I am going to be sending a variety for the next 3 or 4
issues. This pasta salad is one you can make early in the day and have it ready for lunch or
dinner..... or your favorite potluck.

It's best if it sits a while so the flavors can blend. I've made it with various changes. Sometimes
I add a handful of fresh frozen peas. I also use red or yellow peppers if I have them on hand.
The dressing is just a bit different, using dill and oregano, but it's a nice change. This salad
lends itself well to all kinds of adaptations.

## The Recipe
* 3 cups uncooked shell pasta
* 1 cup halved cherry tomatoes
* 1 cup diced green pepper
* 1 cup diced celery
* 1 cup shredded or diced cheese
* 1/2 cup chopped green onions
* 1/2 cup sliced ripe olives

Dressing:
* 1/3 cup salad oil
* 1/4 cup lemon juice (fresh is better)
* 1/4 cup cider vinegar
* 1 tsp. balsamic vinegar
* 1 tsp. dried dill weed
* 1 tsp. dried oregano
* 1 tsp. chopped fresh parsley
* 1 tsp. chopped fresh cilantro
* 1 tsp. salt
* 1 tsp. sugar
* 1/4 tsp. pepper

Cook pasta according to package directions. Drain and rinse in cold water. Place in a large
bowl. Whisk together the dressing ingredients in a small bowl.

Pour over the salad, stirring gently to coat. Cover and refrigerate until serving. If it seems a little
dry after several hours, add a little more vinegar and oil. Serves 8-10.
