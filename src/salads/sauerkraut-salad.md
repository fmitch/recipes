# Sauerkraut Salad
From Analaine's Home Cooking

Mt. Angel, Oregon is a quaint little town on the western slopes of the Cascade Range, settled by
German immigrants in the late 1880s.
It is noted for its many dairies, its monastery, AND its annual Oktoberfest, held every fall.
Bonnie and I enjoyed the day there, admiring the German dress (yes, even men in skirts), the
music, the dancing, the little shops featuring hand-made wares, and of course, the food.
We had wiener schnitzel and sauerkraut salad at a little sidewalk cafe. The owner agreed to give
us his recipe after we asked for a second, maybe a third helping of salad. This makes a lot! It is
probably enough to feed a crowd or take to your favorite potluck.

You will find it a nice complement to any kind of pork â€” pork chops, pork roast, pork patties,
meat loaf, baked ham, ham in a variety of casseroles, and especially wiener schnitzel.

## Sauerkraut salad
* 1 large can (or jar) sauerkraut (drain and wash)
* 1 shredded cabbage
* 4 medium-large grated carrots
* 2 chopped red and green peppers
* 1 large chopped onion
* 1 cup chopped celery

Mix this together in a large bowl. In a separate bowl mix the dressing:
* 2 cups sugar
* 1 1/4 cups light vinegar
* 2 tablespoons caraway seeds
* 3 tablespoons olive oil
* Juice of 2 lemons

Stir dressing well until sugar is dissolved. Mix together and enjoy! This will keep several days
in the refrigerator (if there is any left over).
