# Southwest Summer Salad - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

Here's a recipe from my granddaughter Jena, who lives in Texas. For a young married gal, she
is really a very fine cook. I suppose that comes from being the oldest daughter in a family of six
children. With a working mother, she learned early on to have dinner ready when her mother
got home from work. Of course she likes to cook, so that helps. Here's her creation of a healthy
summer salad.

The use of lime juice rather than lemon, along with taco seasoning gives this dressing a nice
little snap. Other ingredients or vegetables could be added. I often dice (not slice) some fresh
zucchini or add some olives. No cooking involved on a hot summer day for this healthy dish.

## The Recipe
* 2 or 3 large ripe tomatoes, diced
* 1 can whole kernel corn, drained
* 1 can black beans, drained and rinsed
* 1 can red kidney beans, drained and rinsed
* 1 can white beans, drained and rinsed
* 1 c. finely chopped celery
* 1/2 c. finely chopped onions
* 1 avocado, diced
* 2 TB cilantro, finely chopped
* 2 TB parsley, finely chopped

Put in a large salad bowl and top with this dressing:
* Juice of one lime (11/2 TB or so)
* Equal part salad oil (1 1/2 TB or so)
* 1 tsp. taco seasoning (more if you like)
* Salt and pepper to taste
