# Vegetable Beef Salad - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

This recipe came from my friend Hildegard, who lives in Germany. I had never tasted anything
like this in the States before, and found it quite interesting. Chicken in salads, yes, but not beef.
She used a round steak, well-cooked, but I've made it with left-over roast.

I've also cut up a sirloin steak into small cubes and fried that with a bit of salt, pepper, and
garlic powder. You could use chicken, I suppose. That should work with this combination of
veggies.

This is best made ahead of time and allowed to marinate overnight in the fridge. It does make a
lot, probably enough to serve 12 or more. It's great for a potluck, or a hearty one-dish meal for
your family.

## Vegetable Beef Salad
* 2 cups cooked beef
* 2 cans cut green beans
* 1 red bell pepper
* 1 green bell pepper
* 1 yellow bell pepper
* 1 large sweet onion
* 1 cup chopped celery
* 2 or 3 tomatoes

Dressing:
* 2 TB. powdered curry
* 4 TB. salad oil
* 4 TB. vinegar
* 2 tsp. sugar
* 1/2 tsp. salt

Chop peppers, onion, tomatoes and celery into small pieces. Combine with green beans and
meat in a large bowl. Whisk together the vinegar, oil, curry, salt, pepper, and sugar. Pour
dressing over all ingredients. Mix carefully. Cover with plastic wrap and put in refrigerator.
