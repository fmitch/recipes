# Wheat-Fish Salad - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

When Kay and Jean Haws (from Bountiful, Utah) send their annual Christmas letter, they
always include a recipe along with their family news. This is one they sent me over 30 years
ago, and I'v made it many times. It happens to be a favorite of my grand-daughter Kate.

It's filling and nutritious, and a good way to use up the wheat you have in storage. I've been
known to add other veggies to it, like diced young zucchini, or a handful of fresh or frozen peas.
You will notice the absence of salt. I think there is enough already in the salad dressing and
tuna.

Years ago a can of tuna had 7 oz. Now there's only 5 oz., so you may want to add more.
Sometimes I make this with Mayo instead of Miracle Whip, so whatever is your preference. It's
best to make this ahead of time, and let it chill overnight in the fridge for the flavors to meld.

## Wheat-Fish Salad
* 2 cups of dry whole wheat berries to make 4 cups cooked wheat
* 1 can tuna, drained
* 1 cup Miracle Whip
* 1 cup finely chopped celery
* 1/2 cup finely chopped onion
* 1/4 cup finely chopped sweet pickle or relish

Boil 2 cups of dry whole wheat berries in 6 cups of water until soft, but still chewy. Drain. Put
in large bowl. Add the rest of the ingredients. Mix well. Cover with plastic wrap and chill. It
gets better overnight. Serve on a lettuce leaf. Enough for 6.
