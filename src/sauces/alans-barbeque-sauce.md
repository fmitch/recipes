# Alan's Barbeque Sauce - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

My son Alan runs beef cattle on a ranch in Utah's west desert.
Since he raises beef and does a lot of cooking outside on the grill, he thought he should come up
with his own barbecue sauce. He says he has tried almost every brand on the market, but finds
he adds a little something to each one: a little vinegar here, more molasses there, etc., so he
decided to start from scratch one day. It has 14 ingredients and that's a lot to bother with, but the
end result is phenomenal! It's worth the bother. I've tried this on pork spare ribs as well as beef
and it is finger-licking good!

The last time I made this I thought it would be better with a little more bite to the sauce, so I
would add more liquid smoke, not just 2 drops, but at least 1/2 teaspoon or more. It's also great
on chicken, especially wings and thighs. If you want a touch of Hawaiian flavor, add lemon
juice, lime juice, pineapple juice and a little brown sugar.

## Alan's barbeque sauce
* 1 small can tomato paste
* 1/4 cup molasses
* 1/2 cup honey (dark is good)
* 1/4 cup orange juice concentrate
* 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
* 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
* 3 tablespoons prepared mustard
* 1 teaspoon Tabasco sauce
* 2 cloves crushed garlic
* 2 drops liquid smoke
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* 1 teaspoon soy sauce
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* Fresh ground pepper (to taste)

Put spare ribs in a large plastic bag and cover with the sauce. Marinate at least 4 hours or
overnight if possible. These are best if cooked on the grill at medium heat. Turn and baste the
meat often. Cook to your preferred doneness. They can be baked in the oven, if necessary,
covered loosely with foil for an hour at 325Â°. Remove the foil and turn the oven on broil brown
them. Watch carefully so they don't burn. Enjoy!
