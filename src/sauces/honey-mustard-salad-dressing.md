# Honey Mustard Salad Dressing - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

It doesn't matter the time of year, it seems that salads are on the menu the year around.
Here's a recipe I think you will like. It's a nice change from the usual, traditional ones.
I got it from my friend, Colleen, and have had it for quite some time. It's simple to make and
oh! so good.

This makes a little over 1 cup, but is so easy to double or triple the recipe and keep some in the
fridge.

## Honey Mustard Salad Dressing
* 1/2 cup honey
* 1/4 cup vegetable oil
* 1/4 cup lemon juice
* 2 T prepared mustard
* 1 T Dijon mustard

In a small bowl, whisk all ingredients together until they are well blended. You can toss it
sparingly on the salad, or serve separately in a small pitcher for each individual to add to their
own. PD
