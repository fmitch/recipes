# Sweet Zucchini Relish - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

Seems like I've always made pickles and relish in the late summer when cucumbers and onions
are plentiful. One year my friend Doris Morgan brought me a little jar of her zucchini relish. It
was so much better than mine. I just had to have the recipe.
I've been making it for nearly 40 years now, and it continues to be a favorite with the family.
My kids and grandkids used to turn the old-fashioned food grinder for me, but of course the
food processor is the way to go now.
When I ask what I can give them for Christmas, they tell me wild blackberry jam and zucchini
relish. It is sweet, and does call for more sugar than you might think. It's also a little more mild
than cucumber, and we like it better.

It's great with any kind of meat or cheese sandwich, with hamburgers or hotdogs, or as a
condiment with roast beef, pork, or turkey. Mix it with a little mustard for baked ham. Yummy!
Sweet zucchini relish

## Recipe
* 12 cups of prepared zucchini (if it's young you can leave the skins on; if not, be sure to peel it
and remove the seeds).
* 4 cups onions
* 5 tablespoons salt

Use the food processor. Put in large plastic bowl. Sprinkle with salt. Stir. Let sit overnight. Next
morning, drain and wash off salt. Then put into large pan. (I use my pressure cooker.) Then add:
* 4 medium grated carrots
* 1 teaspoon nutmeg
* 2 red peppers
* 1 teaspoon turmeric
* 2 green peppers
* 1 teaspoon dry mustard
* 2 1/2 cups apple cider vinegar
* 2 teaspoons celery seed
* 5 cups sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
* 1/2 teaspoon pepper

Stir with a large wooden spoon and cook for 2 minutes. Then add 1/4 cups cornstarch dissolved
in 1/2 cup water. Continue cooking on medium-high heat for another 10 min. Seal in hot
sterilized jars, then put in hot water bath for 10 min.
