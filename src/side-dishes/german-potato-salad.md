# Analaine's Home Cooking: German Potato Salad
My daughter Karma lives in Germany. I try to visit her and her family once a year if I can. I
have enjoyed a different cuisine while over there. One day in a quaint little restaurant I saw
potato salad on the menu, served with a pork roast or wienerschnitzel. What? Potato salad with
a hot meal! That's a summer dish and a standard part of an outdoor picnic. I thought I would try
it anyway. I was surprised at how good it was. When her friend, Hildegard Gartner, from
Mainz, Germany came to visit, she made it for us. It's so simple to make I could hardly believe
it.

The German potatoes are firm, more like a cross between a Red and a Yukon Gold. I've tried
this with Russets, but they break down too much. If you decide to use Russets, be sure to under-
cook them or the end result will be too mushy.

Somebody brought this salad cold to a church potluck and it was the first bowl to be emptied.
Just goes to show this can be served cold, but I think it's really better served hot as a side dish
with a regular meal. Try it sometime instead of rice or other potatoes - you just may like it.

I've seen other recipes that add a lot of bacon and green and red peppers. That's good too, but
it's not authentic German.

## The Recipe
* 8 to 10 potatoes
* 2 cubes of beef bullion dissolved in 1 cup of boiling watter
* 1/4 c. salad oil
* 1/4 c. apple cider vinegar 
* 1/2 c. finely chopped onions

Wash 8 to 10 potatoes. Leave skins on and boil in salted water. Cook until just barely tender.
Drain, then skin and dice them into a large bowl.

In another bowl dissolve 2 cubes of beef bullion in 1 cup of boiling water. Add the following
ingredients to this hot broth mixture: 1/4 c. salad oil, 1/4 c. apple cider vinegar, and 1/2 c. finely
chopped onions. Stir together and pour over potatoes. Mix lightly and serve warm.

I usually put this dish in the oven on 250Â° for a few minutes while I'm getting the rest of dinner
on the table.
