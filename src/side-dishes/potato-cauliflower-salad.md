# Analaine's Home Cooking: Potato-Cauliflower Salad
This is a little different twist on a potato salad, but one I like to take to a picnic because there
are no eggs in it. It's also quite versatile; you can add other ingredients to it if you like, such as
chunks of ham, frozen fresh peas, green peppers, etc. The original recipe called for feta cheese,
or crumbled blue cheese, but I don't always have that on hand, so just use cheddar. I like that
better anyway.

I think you will find it a nice change.

## Potato-Cauliflower Salad
* 12 small fingerling or round new potatoes, scrubbed
* 1 medium head cauliflower, cut into bite-sized pieces
* 1 medium-small onion, chopped
* 2 stalks of celery, diced
* 1/2 cup sour cream
* 1/4 cup mayo
* 1 TB lemon juice
* 1 TB salad oil
* 2 slices bacon, cooked and crumbled
* 1/2 cup cheddar cheese, grated or diced
* 1/2 cup diced red bell pepper
* 1/4 cup fresh (flat-leaf) parsley, chopped

Cook potatoes with 1/2 tsp. salt until tender. Drain. In another pan, steam the cauliflower until
tender-crisp. Drain and put in ice water for a minute or two to cool. Drain again. In a large
serving bowl combine the potatoes, cauliflower, onion and celery. In a small bowl stir together
the sour cream, mayo, lemon juice and salad oil. Gently toss with the potato mixture, then add
the cheese and red bell pepper. Cover and refrigerate for several hours. Just before serving, taste
for salt, then top with parsley, bacon, and freshly ground black pepper. Makes 8-10 servings.
