# Stuffed Tomatoes - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

The tomatoes are on, and my how we enjoy them! A fresh picked tomato, sweet and juicy, full
of flavor, is so much better than those picked green and allowed to ripen unnaturally.

Bacon-lettuce-tomato sandwiches have never tasted so good.

We've stacked them on hamburgers, eaten them whole like an apple, and canned some for soups
this winter.
These stuffed tomatoes are a tasty dish, and good enough for a special luncheon. They take a
little time, but are worth the effort. This stuffing is essentially what you would make for roasted
chicken or turkey. I've also used hamburger and rice stuffing like you would for stuffed
peppers.
If you wanted a Spanish flair you could add a little cumin and chili powder. If you don't have
the fresh herbs called for in this recipe, you can substitute a teaspoon of Italian Seasoning in
their place.

## Stuffed tomatoes
* 6 firm tomatoes
* 3 bacon strips
* 1/4 cup chopped onion
* 1/4 cup finely chopped cabbage or grated zucchini
* 1/2 cup chopped celery
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* A little pepper
* 1 teaspoon finely chopped basil
* 1 teaspoon finely chopped oregano
* 2 cups dry cubed bread
* 1 egg, beaten

Wash tomatoes. Cut off tops and scoop out centers. Set centers aside for other use. (The original
recipe said to add it to the dressing, but find that too gooey).

Cut bacon into 1" pieces and fry on medium-low heat. Sauté onions, celery, and cabbage in
bacon fat until tender, and then add bread cubes and seasonings.

Mix well. Remove from heat. Add beaten egg. Fill tomato shells with mixture. Place in a
greased baking dish. Bake in moderate (350°) oven for 25. Serves 6.
