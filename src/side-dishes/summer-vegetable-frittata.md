# Summer Vegetable Frittata - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

Frittatas are quiches without the crust. They have recently become popular, as they are lower in
carbohydrates than traditional quiches. My granddaughter Jena sent this to me over a year ago.
It was just the kind of thing I had been looking for to use my zucchini, although you could
certainly use any garden vegetable.

It's good with asparagus and spinach, or yellow squash and mushrooms. I have omitted the bell
pepper at times, but always added the onions. Sometimes I've used scallions or chives, even
bacon bits.

I might even add some lemon pepper for a little bit of zing, or maybe a touch of fresh herbs,
since I like basil, thyme and savory. My herb garden is just a few steps from my back door, so
that makes it convenient.

Essentially, this is almost an omelet, only baked. It would make a hearty breakfast, brunch, or
lunch. Add a salad and a whole-wheat roll and you have a nutritious meal. With some of your
own personal tweaking, this could be a great recipe for summer.

## Summer Vegetable Frittata
* 6 eggs
* 1/4 cup milk
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1/8 teaspoon pepper
* 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese
* 3/4 cup shredded zucchini
* 1/4 cup chopped red bell pepper
* 3 tablespoons chopped onion

Heat oven to 350Â°. Beat eggs, milk, salt and pepper in medium bowl until blended. Add cheese,
onion, zucchini (or other garden vegetables) and mix well.

Add approximately 1/4 cup into each greased muffin cup, OR put into a greased 9" glass pie
plate. Bake in oven until just set, 20 to 22 minutes (25 minutes for pie plate). Cool on rack for 2
or 3 minutes. Remove from muffin cups. Serve warm.
