# Wheat Chips - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

These Wheat Chips are a good substitute for potato chips. They are about the same thickness,
but baked instead of fried. I've had this recipe since the 1970's when there was a big push in our
area for cooking with more whole wheat. I change it from time to time, adding flax seeds,
sunflower seeds, or caraway.

Once in a while I use a seasoned salt, or garlic or onion. However, I like it best just plain. I've
even tried it with a tablespoon of Zoom cereal to give it a little more body. If the batter seems a
little thick before you get to the last batch, just add a little water. This makes about 100 chips,
20 on each tray.

## Wheat chips
* 1 1/2 cup water
* 2 T vegetable oil
* 3/4 tsp. salt
* 1 cup whole wheat flour

Mix all ingredients together with a whisk until no lumps remain. Spread paper-thin on a greased
cookie sheet, using only a teaspoon of batter for each chip. Bake at 375Â°F for 10 minutes.

Edges will start to curl up from pan when they are almost done. Check closely so center is dry.
Baking on an ungreased teflon-coated pan produces a crisper cracker.
