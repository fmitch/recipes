# Wild Rice Casserole - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

This recipe came from my long-ago neighbor, Karen Thomas. She was a nurse, and with her
busy schedule she ate mostly soup and sandwiches during the week.
However, on the weekends when her family came to visit she loved to make hearty casseroles.
They were always healthy and filling, and I was lucky enough to get a morsel of left-overs once
in a while.

Karen used canned mushrooms (I suppose it's because she had them in her food storage), but
they do make the casserole darker. Fresh ones are better, or you could eliminate them altogether
if you're not a big fan of mushrooms.
It still makes a tasty side dish. Sometimes I add green or red peppers, which adds another level
of flavor as well as color. I've even been known to add left-over chicken or hamburger and
serve it as a main dish.

## Wild Rice Casserole
* 1 cup wild rice
* 1 TB butter
* 1 TB oil
* 1/2 cup diced onion
* 1/2 cup diced celery
* 1/2 cup diced or grated carrot
* 1/2 tsp. minced garlic
* 1 can mushrooms
* 1 can water chestnuts, cut in strips
* 1 TB soy sauce
* 1 TB Worcestershire sauce
* 1/4 tsp. pepper
* 2 cans chicken broth
* 1/4 to 1/2 cup slivered almonds

In a heavy frying pan on medium heat, saute the onions in oil and butter. Add the mushrooms,
the water chestnuts and the rest of the vegetables.

Mix together, then add the rice, seasonings and chicken broth. Pour into a casserole dish. Top
with slivered almonds. Cover and bake 1 1/2 hours in 325Â° oven. Serves 6 to 8.
