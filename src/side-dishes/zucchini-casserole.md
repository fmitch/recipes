# Zucchini Casserole - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

I've been collecting zucchini recipes for over 50 years now. In fact, I have so many I keep them
in a separate notebook.
Those who tend to steer away from zucchini should be aware that one cup of this cooked squash
contains only 30 calories.
Nutrients include 1 gram of protein, 8 grams carbohydrates, 52 milligrams calcium and 820
units of vitamin A.

There are countless ways to use this prolific squash. It's great in a casserole with almost any
kind of meat – chicken, beef, bacon, ham, turkey, or no meat at all. Choose whatever vegetables
you like: tomatoes, onion, celery, cauliflower, carrots, potatoes, peas, even corn. Use your
favorite blend of spices and herbs.

This recipe is a little different. It's healthy and filling. My long-ago neighbor, Geneva Wright
gave it to me, and I've changed it a little. Since I have an herb garden just outside my back door,
I use fresh herbs whenever I can. I've also made it with crisp bacon instead of mushrooms.
Sometimes I add a little garlic.

Geneva admitted to peeling the squash before cooking it so her teenage sons wouldn't recognize
the zucchini. Smart lady.

## Zucchini casserole
* 4 to 5 cups of peeled and diced zucchini
* 1 small can mushrooms, drained
* 3 eggs, beaten
* 3/4 cup milk
* 1 cup grated cheese (more if you like)
* 1/4 cup finely chopped onions
* 1 teaspoon fresh savory or thyme, chopped fine
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* Dash of pepper
* 2 Tablespoons melted butter
* 2 cups soft bread crumbs

If you use large squash remove the seeds as well as the peelings. Cook zucchini in small amount
of water until soft. Drain and mash. Beat eggs and add milk, mushrooms, onion, mashed
zucchini, cheese, salt and pepper. Turn into a greased casserole dish (1 1/2 quart s or 2 quarts).

Top with bread crumbs which have been tossed in butter. Bake at 350° until set (about 50
minutes). Serves 6.
