# 5-Hour Beef Stew - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

I first became acquainted with this recipe in l981 when my husband and I went to visit a sister-
in-law in Rexburg, Idaho. They were big potato farmers and were victims of the Teton Dam Flood. They had re-built their homes, barns, and potato sheds, and wanted to take us sight-seeing for the day.

Before we left, we all helped Helen "throw together," as she said, this 5-Hour Stew. She set the
oven at 275째, put a tight lid on the pan, and we left the house.

We drove all over the Rexburg, Sugar City, St. Anthony area, looking at what had happened
that fateful day when the dam broke. We also spent a couple hours at the museum in Rexburg. It
was almost unbelievable to see the pictures of the devastation.

When we returned five hours later, dinner was ready to put on the table. What a treat! You
should keep this in mind the next time you have company and plan an excursion for the day. If
you are going to be gone longer than five hours you can reduce the heat to 250째 for 6 hours, or
225째 for 7-8 hours.

## The Recipe
* 2 lbs. boneless beef cubes
* 3 cups potatoes, cut in 1 1/2" cubes
* 2 cups cut-up carrots
* 1 cup chopped celery
* 1 cup chopped onion
* 1 can tomato soup
* 1 can water
* 1 tsp. salt, 1/4 tsp. pepper
* 1 tsp. garlic
* 1 TB. Worcestershire sauce
* 1 pkg. Italian spaghetti sauce mix
* 2 tsp. Italian seasoning
* 2 TB. miniature tapioca

Combine all ingredients and put in pan with tight-fitting lid. Meat does not have to be browned
first, although you can if you want to hurry the process a bit. I always figure 1 potato per
person, so you can adjust this for more or less.

Bake at 275째 for 5 hours. This makes 6 or more generous servings.
