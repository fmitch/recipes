# Black Bean Vegetarian Chili - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

My friend Wilma likes soup almost as much as I do. Last week she brought me a couple of
recipes along with a sack of yams that had to be used right away. Her recipe called for 2 cups of
diced meat (a good way to use left-over turkey or chicken).

She used hamburger, but I decided to try it a la vegetarian, and my family really liked it. She
also suggested using pumpkin or mashed squash, but I like the chunks of yams better. If you do
use the pumpkin, it makes for a thicker soup and you may want to add more broth.
You will notice that I eliminated the salt. The canned tomatoes and beans seem to have enough
for me. Add what you like.

## Black bean vegetarian chili
* 2 cups yams, cut into 1-inch cubes
* 1 medium onion, diced
* 1 red or yellow pepper, diced
* 1/2 cup diced celery
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 2 cans black beans, with juice
* 1 quart canned tomatoes
* 2 cups chicken broth
* 2 teaspoons parsley flakes
* 2 teaspoons dried oregano
* 1 tablespoon chili powder
* 1 tablespoon cumin

In a medium-size saucepan cook the yams in about a cup of water until just barely tender. Don't
let them get mushy. Set aside. In a larger pan saute the onion, celery and garlic in the olive oil
until translucent.

Combine all the rest of the ingredients. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for at least
30 minutes for flavors to blend. Or you could put it in a crock pot on low for an hour or so.
Served with hot biscuits, this makes a great supper on a cold stormy night.
