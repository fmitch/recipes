# Bok Choy Soup - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

My granddaughter, Lorraine Zhang, recently visited me from Germany. Since her husband is
Chinese, they do a lot of Oriental cooking.
This is a soup they make quite often, and she made it here for me.
It's delicious, colorful, nutritious, and easy to make. Just the thing for a cool autumn evening.

## Bok Choy Soup
* 4 or 5 green onions (1 bunch)
* 4 cloves garlic
* 2 or 3 teaspoons fresh grated ginger
* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 2 stalks celery, with leaves
* 1 1/2 cups sliced carrots
* 1 small head Chinese cabbage
* 2 quarts water
* 5 beef bullion cubes
* 2 tablespoons fresh chopped parsley
* 1 teaspoon soy sauce
* A little pepper

Put oil in a large soup pot. Turn heat to medium-low and saut√© chopped onions, ginger and
garlic until soft. Then add carrots and sliced celery, and fry for a few minutes. Add water and
bullion cubes.

Chop the cabbage in about 1-inch pieces and add to the soup, along with the parsley, soy sauce,
and pepper. Cook about 5 minutes, until carrots and cabbage are as soft as you like them. This
makes about 6 generous servings.
