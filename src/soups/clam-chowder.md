# Clam Chowder - AHC

Our friends, Rich and Sandi Candland, lived on the Oregon Coast. One summer they invited us
over for a weekend to go clam-diggin'. That's been over 30 years ago, and yet, I remember it
like it was last week.

They had checked the tides so that we would be on the beach at the most optimum time for
success. We bought a new clam shovel for the event and gave each of the kids a plastic bucket
in which to keep their stash.

Once you saw the bubble in the sand, you made a mad dash for it, jabbed the shovel down, then
quickly reached your arm in to retrieve the clam. You had to be fast, or it would get away.

After a couple of hours, we had had enough and took our treasure back to the house. Then
began the gruesome task of cleaning them. What an experience! For supper that night, Sandi
made a steaming pot of clam chowder which we devoured with hot french bread.

I regret to say that some spoonfuls contained a bit of gritty sand. Clam chowder is still one of
our family favorites, but in the years since then, I have opted to buy them in the can. As for our
clam shovel? We managed to give it away.
