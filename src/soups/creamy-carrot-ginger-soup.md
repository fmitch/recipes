# Creamy Carrot-Ginger Soup - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

I have a friend in the Daughters of the American Revolution who runs a little restaurant. This is
one of her featured soups and is popular with her clientele.
She makes it a little spicier than I like, by adding 1 or 2 jalapeno peppers and fresh grated
ginger. I always omit peppers, since they give me problems ... but try it!

## Creamy Carrot-Ginger Soup
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 lb carrots (about 4 cups peeled and sliced)
* 1 tablespoon minced ginger (or 2 teaspoons dried ginger)
* 4 to 6 cups chicken stock
* 1 cup diced onions
* 1 jalapeno (optional)
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 cup diced celery
* 1/2 teaspoon white pepper
* 1 TB minced garlic
* 1 bay leaf
* 1/2 cup heavy cream
* 1/2 cup sour cream
* Chopped chives for garnish

In a 4-quart stock pot, saute onions and celery in the oil or butter. Add ginger and garlic, then
the carrots, and cook about 7 to 8 minutes until the carrots are lightly caramelized.

Add the stock, salt, pepper, and bay leaf and bring to a boil, then reduce to simmer. Cook until
the carrots are tender (about 15 to 20 minutes). Remove the bay leaf and puree in batches in the
blender.

Put back in the stock pot and add the heavy cream. Keep hot, but don't boil. To serve, garnish
with 1 TB sour cream per serving and a sprinkling of fresh chives. Serves 6.
