# Roasted Root Vegetable Soup - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

Robert Newell was an early Oregon pioneer who was influential in establishing the provincial
government in Oregon. His home is now a State Park and is open throughout the year.
It was a cold rainy day when we went to decorate it for the Christmas season. When lunchtime
arrived we were treated to bowls of this hot steaming soup.

The director (and cook) there called it "Cider Glazed Roasted Root Vegetable Stew." I've
shortened the name a bit. The use of cider was a surprise to me, and I suppose you could leave it
out; but really, it gives it a unique taste.
Roasting the vegetables also enhances the flavor. Try this some cold winter day, along with a
big chunk of garlic cheese bread. It makes a great lunch.

## Recipe

* 1 cup each of: potatoes, parsnips, turnips, yams, rutabagas, carrots — peeled and diced into 1/2-
inch cubes
* 1 medium onion (or leek)
* 2 cups apple cider
* 1 teaspoon minced garlic
* 3 tablespoons oil
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 4 cups vegetable or chicken stock
* 2 bay leaves
* 1 tablespoon fresh chopped thyme (or dried)
* 1 tablespoon fresh chopped sage
* Salt and pepper to taste

Pre-heat oven to 400°. In a large bowl toss the vegetables with the oil. Spread on a cookie sheet
and place in the oven. Roast for about 15 minutes. Remove from oven. Salt and pepper lightly.

In a large heavy pot, melt the butter on medium-low heat. Add the onion (or leek). Sauté for
about 3 minutes. Add the cider and vegetables, and cook for 10 minutes.

Then add the stock, vegetables, garlic and seasonings. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer
and cook for another 30 minutes. Add more stock (or water) if you like it thinner.
