# Taco Soup - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

There is nothing quite as good as a steaming hot bowl of homemade soup on a cold winter
night. This recipe for Taco Soup is so easy to make you can't believe it. Tastes like you've been
laboring over the kitchen stove all day, but in reality it can be made and on the table in a matter
of minutes. It's hearty, nutritious and full of fiber. A batch of corn bread is a nice complement to
this. If you are in a hurry, the soup can be made while the corn bread is in the oven.

## Recipe
* 1 pound hamburger
* 1 medium-small onion, chopped
* 1/2 cup finely chopped celery
* 1 package taco seasoning
* 1 can whole kernel corn
* 1 can black beans
* 1 can red kidney beans
* 1 can garbanzo or navy beans
* 1 quart tomatoes
* 1 can water

Brown the hamburger, drain off any excess fat. Add onions and celery. Cook until the onions
are translucent, then add the taco seasoning, corn (with juice), beans, tomatoes and water. Bring
to a boil. (The original recipe said to drain the beans, but I dump in the whole can). You really
don't need to add salt or pepper because the taco seasoning is enough. Any time I cook with
tomatoes I add a spoonful of sugar. I think it enhances the flavor a bit. You may garnish this at
serving with a dollop of sour cream, grated cheese and/or chopped cilantro. Serves 6 to 8.
