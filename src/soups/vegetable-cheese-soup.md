# Vegetable-Cheese Soup - AHC
From Analaine's Home Cooking

January is the month for soups. It's cold and stormy outside, and nothing quite hits the spot like
a bowl of hot homemade soup. I'm known as the "Soup Queen" among my friends, and that is
okay with me. I could eat soup every day all winter long.

This vegetable soup is hearty and healthy. It's pretty basic and yet simple. You certainly could
add other vegetables, like broccoli or cauliflower.
If you have chicken stock on hand, you can use that instead of (or along with) the bouillon
cubes. The addition of dry mustard gives it a little snap. It's a bit bland without it. You don't
need to add salt; the bouillon cubes make it plenty salty.

## Vegetable-cheese soup
* 3 cups water
* 2 cups diced potatoes
* 1 cup diced onion
* 1 cup diced carrots
* 1 cup chopped celery (Add some celery leaves as well. They always enhance soup.)
* 6 chicken bouillon cubes

Cook the above until tender. Don't drain.
Then add:
* 1/4 cup butter
* 2 cups milk (whole milk is better), mixed with 1/2 cup flour.

Stir until soup boils and thickens.
Then add:
* 1/2 teaspoon dry mustard
* 1/8 teaspoon pepper
* 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh (or dried) parsley

Grate 2 cups cheese (cheddar is best). Add to soup, but don't boil. Serve immediately. This
makes enough for 6 to 8 hungry people.
